Review,Cosin Similarity
"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes
a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales.",0.7211274786793167
"Lovely plot, great characters, awesome designs & costumes. As a martial artist fan I loved the fight choreography & stunts. They felt fresh and authentic.The mix between Martial Arts, Action, Fantasy & Drama was great. I was worried about the movie, when I watched the trailer. The CGI effects were amazing. Just felt like it didn't needed it. The movie got its own marvel flavor, when the cgi scenes took over.I had a lot of fun during watching. Specially the fighting scenes, action scenes and with a lovely humor.The acting was fantastic. Shang-Chi's character development was great just overshadowed by his fathers character in my opinion, cause the story of his father was somehow more interesting. The chemistry between Shang-Chi & Katy was the icing on the cake. So lovely and perfectly matches into the movie.This is the first Hollywood movie for Tony Leung. He did an amazing job.I think it's safe to say they did well to represent Asian culture on a big movie screen. I highly recommend this to every marvel fan. They did an outstanding job.",0.6811278845146835
"First thing first is the cast in Shang-Chi is excellent. Every performance is great and the chemistry between Shang and Katie is excellent. I am so glad the movie did not create a forced love-interest plot between the two friends. A few of the action sequences are good and better than what we received in Black Widow. The bus fight scene in the first third of the movie in particular is a standout.45 minutes into the movie when Shang-Chi is reunited with his father I was bored beyond belief until the last act of the movie. The film switches gears and continuously dumps exposition on the audience. Everything from here becomes the predictable hero needs to accept his true self story we have seen a million times. Which is a shame because the first act of the movie seemed so fresh from what we typically get with MCU movies. The fight in the last act, while entertaining, are the typical CGI mess found in marvel movies. The one on one between Shang and his father was genuinely emotional, but once you add all the CGI dragons/monsters it becomes a mind-numbing bore.Another thing that bothers me is the character development. Excellent performances aside none of the characters go through any deep growth. The story plays out exactly how you would expect with training montages, green screen vistas and humor ruining any moments of tension. For example, Katie seems to be unnecessarily dragged into everything, learns archery in a few hours, survives a vicious battle and hits the monster right in the neck from who knows how far away. It makes my eyes roll into the back of my head thinking about it. The same thing can be said about Shang's sister. The heart wrenching conflict between her and Shang is quickly resolved and there is no character development for her. It's all nonsense and I need a little more substance with my flashy action.All my gripes aside I was entertained in spurts watching Shang-Chi because of the chemistry between it's stars and some decent action scenes. Which makes it all the more frustrating that is falls into the typical MCU formula after it's first act. Marvel take some freaking risks with your story-telling please!",0.64880915778072
"When you thought the MCU pulled everything out of the closet. This movie has everything. Amazing special effects, good editing, deserved character development and an intriguing plot. This movie is a solid blockbuster and very aesthetically pleasing.The only bad thing about it was that at some point in the movie, it's enough. The ending felt like it was being dragged out.This is the best MCU origin story by FAR.",0.6477200035974423
"Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much.",0.6112749816776155
"It's a decent movie. Happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn't overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious. The Mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point. The movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think ""oh it's finishing up"" there's more. There is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw. Acting wise it's cool, nothing amazing or something you haven't seen before.If you're familiar with marvel it's the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (Thor, Black Widow).Wanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie? This is one that you'll like.",0.6101778768735647
Just an another amazing movie brought by MCU with adding a new character to marvel universe. Overall fantastic movie with the point of view of storyline and action sequences which really are one of the best among all marvel movies till now. It is clearly visible by this movie that there's something big planned by MCU in future which would be amazing to watch. At last just watch this movie you will love it.,0.6101778768735646
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is very different from all previous Marvel movies, which is a good thing. I was a little worried at first that the film might not live up to the success Marvel pushed to give, but the film was actually spectacular and very entertaining. Good story, good acting, excellent character development, the action and choreography are outstanding, some funny moments, beautiful cinematography, and the VFX are a major step-up from previous Marvel films. This film was almost like the Aquaman of the MCU because it was a fun experience seeing it on the screen and presenting fans with something entirely new and unfamiliar. This movie is practically flawless. Can't wait to see Shang-Chi in future Marvel movies.",0.6016267534098217
"Just the poster alone says it all, the movie was great. Great writing, great character development, story, acting, villain, comedy and the best fights.Like I just wrote the story was great, maybe you can say AMAZING. All of the character development was awesome to see and really entertaining. It was not at all rushed in the direction and at the same time didn't it bore me.So save to say, it was one of the best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I would watch it again and maybe even three times after that.(sorry for my englis, I'm Russian (Taskmaster yk))",0.6004978428948143
"I once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. The premise is ""Martial-arts master Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization"". So does Shang Chi succeed in giving us a good all Asian cast big blockbuster or is it just another failed attempt?Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts.The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn't overuse humour like in Marvel's previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny.Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi's friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that.Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory. I don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu's health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing.Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi's sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang. She doesn't get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It's a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes.Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can't wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team.",0.6002067034025896
"Tony, Fala and Simu had an absolutely phenomenal performance in this fantastic movie. It's so nice to see more representation of different cultures. This movie did for the Asian community what Black Panther did for the African American community.The action scenes were one of the best of the ANY marvel movie. The choreography was by far the best in any Marvel movie. This movie felt like Ip Man with a mythical story added to it. The action was impeccable. The story was unique and wasn't very generic. I love that Simu does his own stunts too.Marvel NEVER ceases to amaze me. We need more company like this *cough cough Warner Bros and Sony cough cough*So thankful we're getting two more!",0.5991878995344276
"Didn't have high hope before going in because neither Simu nor Awkwafina was a superhero movie casting material, and Mandarin is a very controversial villain of choice, but I was pleasantly surprised on how good Shang-Chi was.The chemistry between Simu and Awkwafina was exceptional, and Tony Leung's casting of Not-Mandarin aka Xu Wenwu was not just amazing, but one of the best villains Marvel has ever seen. It's a villain whose motivation is actually both believable and relatable. Oh, and the actual ""Mandarin"" was also a comical gold.Plus, fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. First half's martial art scenes were on par with some martial arts classics and later half of, well, typical Marvel CGI stuff were quite of eye candies.Sure, there were few less developed character arcs like Shang-Chi's sister but overall, this is an excellent movie that won't disappoint you.",0.5975451796596847
"I saw ""Shang_Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", starring Simu Liu-Taken_tv, Kung Fu Cops; Awkwafina-Jumanji:The Next Level, Ocean's Eight; Tony Chiu_Wai Leung-The Grandmaster, Hard Boiled and Michelle Yeoh-Star Trek:Discovery_tv, Mechanic:Resurrection.This is the first Asian Marvel super hero movie that is based on a minor-not as well known-character. I grew up loving 'The Master of Kung Fu' because of the martial arts aspect and still have the original comic books. FYI: Shang_Chi was originally based-visually-on Bruce Lee. Paul Gulacy-one of the artist at the time-even drew Shang_Chi to look like Bruce Lee. They also made changes-mainly because of political correctness-to his origin story. Originally, Shang_Chi was the son of Fu Manchu, a racially insensitive character. But now, it has been changed to be the son of The Mandarin, an old Iron Man villain. In the comics, The Mandarin had 10 rings on his fingers but here it has been changed to rings on his forearms. These rings shoot energy force bolts and Tony also calls his evil organization, 'The Ten Rings'. Simu plays Shang_Chi and Tony is the Mandarin. In this origin story, you learn what caused their estrangement and why Tony is wanting so badly to reconnect. Awkwafina plays Simu's best friend that tags along on Simu's adventures with glimpses into his past & present life-and lots of fantastic martial arts-and Michelle play's Simu's aunt. If you like The Eagles, you'll probably enjoy the connection to 'Hotel California'. There are several cameos, including a couple of Avengers. As the end credits start, there is a scene and another one at the very end so don't leave too early.It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",0.5975451796596846
"This movie is a blast and then some. It is, just like Black Panther was, a Marvel movie and it's own thing at the same time. It brings a much needed freshness to MCU. The story is about Shang-Chi, a Kung Fu fighter, who is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. Is this the same Ten Rings organization from Iron Man and Iron Man 3? I'll let the movie explain.Director Destin Daniel Cretton successfully blends in his culture in the Marvel format, but also keeps it real, authentic and most importantly communicates a very personal story effectively. At the heart of it, this is a movie about a dysfunctional family dealing with their family drama. I'm not going to talk about what the drama is as that will be a spoiler. But with that drama comes some of the best Kung-Fu fights I've seen on the big screen in a long time.Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and Awkwafina as his best friend are well known stars, but after this movie they will be upgraded to superstar status. They were brilliant in the movie and were yin to each other's yang. Where Simu Liu brought the punches, Awkwafina brought. The punchlines. They complimented each other to create the perfect balance. Another character that left an impression on me is Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Shang-Chi's father. The love-hate relationship between him and Shang-Chi is relatable and just so heartbreaking.Rest of the star cast is also brilliantly casted and this movie has some of the best written supporting characters. The core group consists of Fala Chen as Shang-Chi's mother who is the soul of this movie, Meng'er Zhang as his sister who is just as much of a kick ass as Shang-Chi and Michelle Yeoh as his aunt who becomes his guide and teacher. There is also a surprise character in the movie that I loved, but I am not going to talk about it and spoil it for you guys.This is a Marvel product so you know that the VFX & CGI are industry best. Adding to that are the beautiful Cinematography and the fast paced Camera Work. Each and every fight sequence is meticulously handled and spectacularly choreographed. You have seen some of the bus fight scenes in the trailer, but there are other high stake fight scenes that will also leave you breathless.You knew you were going to watch this movie when it came out. My review is just to tell you that yes, it is everything you expected and wanted it to be. I personally never doubted Kevin Feige. Now go watch this movie and let it knock your socks off.P. S. - This movie has a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene, so make sure you catch those.",0.5939491699103612
"A Marvel Legend has risen and it only took 40 years to become an overnight sensation.""Kim's Convenience"" star Simu Liu breathes life into the title character who's changed his birth name to Shaun.What a stretch when you don't want to be found by your estranged dad, Xu Wenwu otherwise known as The Mandarin, played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (in his first American film) who has more rings than Ringo Starr or the Olympics.What can I say this guy loves his bling.Rapper/Actor Awkwafina is his BFF, Katy.Together Shaun goes out of his way to avoid bringing back the dead with his wisecracking ""Crazy Rich Asian"" girlfriend in tow.Simu was so intent of getting this gig that back in 2018 he tweeted Marvel for the role.Kung Fu fans are in for a solid 2 hour plus fight spectacular, which doesn't stop too long to draw breath.This movie never gets boring.It's Action, Adventure and Fantasy all rolled into one thrill ride straight out of the Marvel Universe.I kind of half expected 80's Singer, Limahl to crank out ""Never Ending Story"" in the final act of this epic movie thanks to one of the legendary creatures hiding out in a mythical village not unlike Shangri-La from 1937's classic ""Lost Horizon"".Car maker BMW clearly have a product placement deal with Producer, Kevin Feige.They are driven, crushed or smashed in every automobile scene.Hawaiian Director, Destiny Daniel Cretton, best known for ""Just Mercy"" and ""The Glass Castle"" does a marvellous job with the Screen Play and Screen Story he helped write based on the source material from Marvel Comics Steve Engelhart and Jim Starlin.This movie idea has been floating around since the 80's when the late Stan Lee wanted Bruce Lee's son, Brandon to play the lead, but that plan fell through.Australia actually played a huge part in this movie finally being produced despite World War C's best attempt in 2020 to shut down production.Watch out for: Michelle Yeoh plus Aussies Ronnie Chieng, Lynette Curran and Lydia Sarks (from the Toyota Commercials) as the hilarious Flight Attendant.Like all good Marvel movies there is an Easter Egg worth waiting for before the cinema lights come on and the curtains close on the big screen.And just like the movie this review doesn't mention the title till the final frame, ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"".Do yourself a favour and take the family to see the 25th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is full of surprises and cameos.MCU's first with an Asian leading Superhero Protagonist!",0.5939192528236894
"You could be mistaken for reading the title and thinking I was being sarcastic.Thankfully,I'm not. Just wow. I've been longing for that wow factor from the cinema since cinemas have reopened and this film gave me everything I wanted.Take away the fact that I am biased towards Marvel movies (guilty) this however is just a fanboy loving that Marvel have delivered once again, by that I mean top tier movies in the realms of Black Panther, Thor 3, GOTG, Infinity wars, Spider-Man just to name a few.From not having any major comic runs, to coming to our screens with this is jaw dropping movie, I can only show nothing but pure joy. From the culture, the mythical folklore, the mix of past/present and let's not forget the secret garden this film expands on the Marvel universe once again with an even deeper history.This film gave me real belly laughs, real emotional moment, a fantastic soundtrack to match this is a genuine winner for this year and Spider-Man may have his hands full beating what I can only describe as the best introduction to a unknown character since BP/GOTG. Shang-Chi needs to be a new staple in the Marvel franchise with new stories moving forward. Not to mention that fantastic performance from Simu Liu which has genuinely made me yearn for more of his portrayal!What an absolute treat and I've only watched it twice with a third viewing feeing more needed as the days go on.5 star all day, every day. Bravo!",0.587248624541748

"Shang-chi, the most disloyal man in MCU: he has 10 rings for 10 wives.Phase 4 continues with a new blockbuster with an all main Asian cast. Having escaped from his father, Shang-chi was forced to face his past and embrace his true self.Is this movie good? The answer should be no, despite how much people overhyped this. However, I did enjoy the fight choreography and beautiful visuals. This honestly doesn't mean a lot, considering that this is a Marvel's project. The cast did an okay job themselves, and some comedic moments land.If you actually take this movie seriously and don't get distracted by all the colors and actions on the screen, it should be clear that this was an overhyped, mediocre at best Marvel movie. It's not bad like Captain Marvel, but it's not good. There is barely any depth to the story. This type of story was done like a gazillion times, and this movie didn't add a lot into the tropes. The progression was formulaic, and you already know what the end would look like from the beginning.Our main character, Shang-chi, again, was typical and bland. The actor wasn't necessarily bad, it's just that the writers didn't try hard enough to make the character more compelling or special. Also, the dude just randomly knew how to crazy stuff near the end, despite never wear the ten rings himself before.Also, in typical Marvel fashion, the phenomenon of ""OH I know that person from somewhere else"" (*insert Leonardo DiCarpio's pointing meme*) was used as another distractor. Sometimes it's good and all, but remember that this made no impact on how good a movie is.Which directs your attention to the post-credit scenes. Again, another overhype train from people. Reality is: they aren't that special.Overall, just calm down people. A mediocre Marvel hero movie. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie. 6.5/10.",0.5859989592574776
"Shang Chi has a hallmark of being a big budget film, but it missed the mark in its attempt to be simultaneously an Asian martial arts film and a marvel film.On the positive side, the animations and the choreography are really well-done, and they demonstrate significant amount of planning and thought. However, the film lacks coherence as it intertwines sharply opposing scenes from a fight club in Macau to a peaceful fantasy Chinese village to downtown San Francisco. Comedy is used to punctuate the film, but they feel very out of place in a movie about a Chinese American aiming to kill his father, an idea that is so opposed to the ordinary Chinese-American worldview that the film should deserve more gravity. The costumes evoke a feeling of the characteristically ineffective attempt by Hollywood to mix Eastern and Western styles. In the village scene, bright artificially-coloured clothes contrast with the natural objects surrounding them (wood statues, old temples, trees, and magical creatures).Additionally, the movie is somewhat cliché, unrealistic, and illogical. The back story is one involving a long-vanquished evil threatening to come back, and the true vanquisher of such evil already lays under a a lake and (presumably) would have prevented the evil from coming back even without the protagonist's help. The side character predictably must be the one who saves the village at the critical moment despite having no prior training in archery whatsoever. Have I become too grown up to appreciate such a storyline? Marvel cannot simply hide its shoddy plot work by pre-empting the critics in the bar scene. Every major scene in the movie have significant similarity with some previous movies. The fight ring was in spiderman; the village was in Kungfu Panda; Fights in buses and scaffoldings have been done countless of times before.So what's new? What makes this movie special? On a martial arts standpoint, it pales in comparison to Tony Leung's previous films. On an ""Asian empowerment"" standpoint, it lacks authenticity and its fantastical nature prevents any serious message from being conveyed. Indeed, the viewers are left wondering whether this movie champions the family or the freedom from it.The characters development is also lackluster. They were the ones who scorn social expectations and the ones who wish to have fun. How did they transition to people who will risk their lives to protect a village?Overall, Shang-Chi seems to disappoint.5/10.",0.5833001626007788
I was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I'm a sucker for a good martial arts movie and for traditional oriental music but we saw what happened the last time Marvel tried to do martial arts... (Iron Fist)This movie is without question in my top 5 Marvel movies! The action is incredibly choreographed and there is not an overabundance of it. The score is beautiful and I have found myself listening to it regularly since I saw this film. Character development is top notch. All of these things needed to make a great movie is wrapped into a nice package sprinkled with that Marvel charm we have come to love over the years. I can't stress how much you need to see this movie.,0.5833001626007787
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn Marvel film that's part-family drama and part-kung fu adventure that is raised by Tony Leung's villainous performance as Wenwu. It delivers a solid introduction to an Asian American superhero while paying tribute to Chinese martial arts films.First off, it's very pleasing to see the warm reception Shang-Chi has received across the world. It's a phenomenon to see English-speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in Mandarin. Back in my university days, the average Western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting ""to read a movie."" Look at how much the world has changed now.The first half of Shang-Chi plays much stronger. The San Francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a Hollywood big-budgeted version of 90's Jackie Chan films set in Western locales, like Rumble in the Bronx, Who Am I or First Strike.The fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia, and plunges into more and more CGI. The former is more engaging with Shang-Chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting.Simu Liu does a solid job as Shang-Chi and has impressive moves. Like an athlete, he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour. Liu grew on me throughout the movie, much to the aid of the always-charismatic Awkwafina as his best friend Katy. They share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own R2-D2 and C-3PO.The film's MVP is Tony Leung, who approaches his role with an award-worthy intensity, injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level.I was amazed by the depth Leung achieved through his scenes. The scene that struck me was a flashback where Tony Leung's Wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family. In that one glance, Leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present. His performance cut right through me and I felt I was watching someone suffer.It is unfortunate as Wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half, which diminishes Leung's character. Wenwu is established as an immortal who's fought for power through the ages, yet there's a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing.Shang-Chi's third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act. The story shifts into a westerner's stereotypical view of China. We get the straw hats, the rice paddy village that looks Cambodian, and the constant mention of dragons. With a CGI-infused finale spectacle, the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half.Shang-Chi is entertaining Marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for Asian American representation. However, as a film, I don't feel the need to revisit it anytime soon. When I will, it will be for the San Francisco section and Tony Leung scenes.I am Asian, not Asian American. I'm happy for other Asian Americans who feel represented by Shang-Chi. I personally do not feel that representation from this film and am fine with that. Looking at the film itself, I admit Shang-Chi is one great step in the Asian American representation fight. However, it's apparent there's still a heck of a long way to go...",0.5792633827421736
"Today I watched the movie ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings."" Overall I quite enjoyed it, but there are a few things I believe could have been done better.First of all there are the characters. Shang Chi himself I believe was lacking when it came to his personality. Both Xialing and Katy had traits that were simple, interesting, and easy to follow. Throughout the film Shang Chi goes from being a less extreme version of Katy to a less extreme version of Xialing. This causes him to be forgettable, as there is a more interesting character with the same personality in the film at all times. It would have been nice to see some of his own traits that are unique and fresh.I think the development of the main heroes could have been more evenly spread across the whole film, as the only noticeable changes I witnessed were after they had reached the village.I think it is also important to talk about Shang Chi's father. He was a very three dimensional character and I really enjoyed his interactions with his son during their final fight. The only thing I would have liked to change about him would be to see him be affected by his old age, surely being around for so long would give him some sort of wisdom. Something that confused me was whether or not he was supposed to be redeemed in the end, as the way other characters felt about him was very inconsistent. While this could have been a fun concept to explore, seeing how his children felt about him and how unsure they were, it was not done correctly. Their feelings changed quickly and it was not shown to us enough for it to be something the audience recognised.The next thing I would like to talk about are the rings. They were confusing, inconsistent, and not explored enough. The abilities the rings possessed were not clear. In one scene Xu Wenwu will take down an army, then lose to one woman. Though she was aided by her powers, many of the moves Xu Wenwu showed during the opening could have been used in many other situations during the film. The rings are built up to be something that can grant you god like powers, but they end up being underwhelming. It does not make sense that Xu Wenwu is not able to take down the Ta Lo army. The people of Ta Lo possess abilities granted to them by the great protector but these powers are never explained or shown. While not all things have to be explained, this movie had too many questions left unanswered. While the after credits scene alluded to an explanation of the rings' origins, I am looking at this movie as a standalone project. None of the magic is given an explanation, that includes the rings and the great protector.My third point will be the plot and the execution of the whole film. The plot was not well done. Many of the points were rushed and introduced very out of nowhere. These points include the introduction of Trevor and Morris. It was a little too convenient that they met someone who just happened to live with something from Ta Lo, and just happened to be able to understand it, and was also willing to help them. Another thing would be the exposition. A few times during this film I felt as if a book was being read to me. There are better ways to tell a backstory than for a character to tell it to us directly. The death of Shang Chi's mother also seemed very random. It seemed as if it was not thought about at all. The gang that killed her was never mentioned before, and they were nor important to the plot in any way, so much so that they were shown to be killed not much after. I also feel it would have been better for Shang chi and his friends to stay in Ta Lo for longer until his father shows up. This is because it would give Katy time to learn about the bow and arrow much more realistically.The climax, which would be when the dweller in darkness appears. The dweller is, like the rings, built up to be something very powerful and ends up being underwhelming. Everything slightly before and after this was rushed, such as the introduction of the gate, which, like many things, was shown through a voice over. It had not been shown before this and we were not given the time to actually think about the dangers it may possess. The appearance of the great protector was also very random and, again, underwhelming.Lastly, the ending. It also made no sense for Shang Che to be able to defeat the dweller that easily, as his father, who had a thousand years to master them, was not able to. If he was also aided by the power of the dragon, this should have been stated. I do think the scene of everyone honoring the dead was done well, and was important for showing how much was sacrificed during the battle.Many of the problems I talked about could have been fixed with better timing, the right foreshadowing, better exposition, and more consistency. All in all I really enjoyed this film, though that may seem a little contradictory with how much I criticised it. I would recommend this film for anyone who enjoys cool action and cool visuals, also if you're looking for fun female characters. I would rate this movie a 7/10.",0.5765762658820675
"Serviceable. That's the word that came to my mind as I left the theatre. Not sure if that's a great pull-quote for the BluRay release, but it'd be mine.Don't get me wrong, I liked this. I had fun and found few things, if at all, that I disliked. But since this is basically Black Panther Jr, it made me appreciate Chadwick Boseman's Similar Origin Story WAAAY more.I had to think about that when I got out of this. Why did I suddenly think the average rating I gave to Black Panther was better than this and then it hit me: Simu Liu can't act nor does he have charisma. Chadwick Boseman on the other hand, had both talents IN SPADES.In fact, Black Panther's entire cast, including the villain, had both: better acting and 100x more charisma. But, again, the actors here gave it their all. No one was bad necessarily, well except for the lead.Meek valet driver Shaun gets attacked on his San Francisco bus commute to work and unbelievably fights back leading to his BFF & world via viral video knowing this mild-mannered passenger is anything but. So, off he goes to save his sister he believes is in danger from their evil dad. And a place in the world, and Avengers, he will find.I know the lead actor/title character from a TV show I just discovered: Kim's Convenience. Yes, Simu Liu's drop-dead gorgeous, but I never really got the impression he was a great actor on the show. I'd hope with a big screen movie he had to carry on his shoulders he'd suddenly show his depth. Nope. If anything, I know less of his talent than I did with the 1st season of his show I've seen so far.Now, his costars? Another story. I loved his Dad played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, definitely his BFF Katy by Awkwafina and I'll always love Michelle Yeoh, Ronny Chieng, Benedict Wong and the one who stole the whole movie and my favorite character: Trevor Slattery. (Don't look him up if you don't know who he is. Just take my word for it: he was the best and funniest character of this movie by a landslide.)And speaking of laughs, normally I don't like when they overload Marvel movies with humor. Both Iron Man 3 and Thor: Ragnarok were 80% comedies, 20% action - which is not the ratio I want my Superhero movies to be. Here, in Shang-Chi, it's toned down a ton and funny when used.The special effects were fine, the pacing was just right, the action was acceptable and I liked the heart shown in the third and best act of the feature. I would recommend it, but it's definitely in the lower half of the 25 MCU movies.Stay for the two end-credit scenes. They actually made them relevant to this movie's plot/Shang-Chi universe.***Final Thoughts: NO SPOILERS, but the best line was from Mr. Liu, himself: ""I'm not Korean!"" he laughs at his own joke. Taken out of context to avoid spoilers, but I wonder if anyone else caught this meaning. He's really Chinese but he plays a Korean in his TV show. I wonder if they threw that in if he ever got slack from his television portrayal. Either way, I thought it was hilarious.",0.5764283705200356
"Shang-Chi is 2.5 hours of your life well spent by basking in the glory of a compelling, profound story with absolutely breathtaking visuals. It's so easy to get lost in the majesty of the world that's being portrayed and to feel like this is your life for a short period. That being said, the movie is a double edged sword; not in terms of the movie itself, but rather the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole.Shang-Chi evokes a feeling that I've only experienced from two other Marvel movies: Black Panther and Dr. Strange. After 10+ years, the whole ""America will save the world"" and ""America is the center of everything"" vibe has grown dull. What these three films all have in common is that they do not focus on the ""America first"" mentality that has been the case with MCU films for so long. They make the universe in which these stories are taking place feel so much richer.The movie starts off with something that I cannot recall ever having been done in an MCU film before: dialogue that is not English. The Chinese dialogue with subtitles automatically makes you feel like this is something different, in the best way possible. What's more, there are numerous instances across the film where characters speak Chinese, which makes the experience feel so much more culturally authentic.The fighting scenes are unlike anything seen in any other Marvel movie. There is a fluidity to the characters' movements which feels like dancing. These moments alone make the movie a must see.The special effects are beyond satisfying. The creatures based on Chinese legends look so lifelike that you genuinely feel like they could exist out in nature. The Great Protector in particular is jaw dropping and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time it's on-screen. Furthermore, any moment involving the Ten Rings is pure visual delight.As for the story, a perfect balance is struck between a grounded human experience and an otherworldly mystical journey. The heartfelt family conflict moments are not the kind of cheesy stuff you usually get in a high budget superhero movie. You really feel for what the characters are going through and are genuinely concerned for their well-being. Furthermore, the otherworldly aspect of the story fits in perfectly with the aforementioned conflict. There are a lot of abstract concepts and creatures that wield strong mystical powers, and when you reach the end of the movie you might think to yourself ""I don't really understand everything that I just saw"". However, that's part of the beauty of this movie. It bridges whats familiar and easily understood with stuff that's very unfamiliar and difficult to comprehend, which leaves you both satisfied and full of wonder.For the longtime MCU fans, Wenwu perfectly explains all the references of the Ten Times dating back to Iron Man 1 and how good organization worked. Trevor Slattery also makes an appearance and plays a pretty significant role in the film, which fulfills the longtime wish of Marvel fans to learn about his fate. His humorous role from Iron Man 3 is perfectly preserved, yet he's also given purpose beyond simply being a joke character. The character is ultimately very satisfying and surpassed all expectations.I could keep going on and on about how great this movie is. It's truly a Marvel masterpiece and deserves all the accolades it will inevitably receive.",0.5744689022370097
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start...""Rating: A-",0.5723834243112861
"I'm not gonna to lie, I wasn't excited for this movie. The first teaser was underwhelming and the official trailer didn't get me hooked either. Either way I'm a huge MCU and Marvel fan so I decided to go watch it either way. IT WAS AMAZING. The film was only 2+ hours but it contained soo much, the setting changed so much. The actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and CGI was spot on. The only complaint is that the movie felt very cringe ish at some times, especially during the first 10 minutes. But the movie gradually got better, still having some cringey scenes during the run. I know some people have their complaints on Awkwafina but she really did a great job. Simu Liu's character was lacking at times though but I'd definitely say he has one of the best debut characters in terms of personality.*And why people are reviewing this now is because it was released on September 1th in a few countries.Also spoiler, Abomination's character only did a very brief appearance, it was so brief so that I was unable to even film him.Also, we have another bad guy who will show up later in the MCU ;)",0.5669655134766497
"Its was great, finally after so long we got to experience good origins story. I know kevin feige will nailed it even after lot of people thought its gonna flop.The movie is like a mixture between western and eastern culture afterall the protagonist is an asian living in american.The raw choreography is the best in the MCU, better than Winter Soldier. The CGI fights is not bad but i think they should do more of the raw realistic fight scene more because its the most appealing part of the movie.Tony Leung is so charismatic even if he is a villain, i can feel sympathetic to his character. The new mythology is cool, the fantastic beast is awesome too
I hope we can see a sequels.",0.5616177386966563
So Shang chi has an evil Kung fu father with sci Fi bracelets and an air bender mother. He leaves his father behind to pursue a simpler chilled life in Sam Francisco and then they the fathers organization attacks him and brings him back to have him help and get to his mothers home village. In the village he fights his father and wins and then fights anime looking monsters which are like dementors/ soul suckers. He gets help from a water bending dragon and defeats the king monster by performing an exorcism with his bracelets. Acting wasn't amazing but let's all appreciate how cool Morris was. Probably the best character in the movie.,0.5616177386966563
"Keeping it short. This movie had it all. Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.I'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.The story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing. The direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second.Best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I can watch this again today after watching it last night.",0.5600412900448475
"Perfect casting, great flow throughout, solid story and character development. Great movie to take the family to watch. Provides many topics for conversation-change for the better, start doesn't dictate the end, see the good in all, cherish our loved ones and many others. For me the mark of a really good movie is the can't wait for the next movie and I can't wait for chapter two!!",0.5600412900448475
"Just came back from the theater. Definitely great movie. Another blockbuster and big win for marvel. Hugely entertaining . It's as good as black panther.Shangchi original story-line is about revenge and blood for blood. Much more serious than other marvel themes. However, the emotions are diluted to the minimum because of his girlfriend Kathy aka awkwafina. I guess that's on purpose. Also Mandarin aka wenwu his father is much less evil than the original. Basically just a powerful guy losing mind for his beautiful wife. Shangchi himself has a funny character as well. So it's become a popcorn movie but still deep with emotions. Best marvel movie since the winter soliderThe only little regret for me is simu Liu's outlook. Man the face only deserves parking cars. I know Jackie Chan is also not good looking but shangchi to me is very handsome guy whose face is at least at the level of Donnie yen. Come on, he's a comic book super hero.It's already making history by breaking record of Labor Day sales of ANY movie, and it's three times more. Actually this movie is very hard to fail. You got Michelle yeoh the female Jackie Chan, tony Leung best actor in HK even China, awkwafina the best Chinese/ Asian American actress, fala Chan very good actress in HK, etc. This is a dream cast like the new Lakers.",0.5596137790777272
"When watching Shang- Chi you will almost immediately see that it follows the same formula as every other marvel movie, but there is one thing that this movie excels at and that is the choreography. The choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general. The character of Shang- chi (played by Simu Liu) is a great addition to the MCU, but I can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character Katy.(played by Awkwafina). The character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though I believe that this is the fault of the writers and not Awkwafina. Another aspect of this movie that I like is the cameos, while I will not mention them to avoid spoilers, I will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the MCU in general. All in all I give Shang-chi a 9 out of 10. Great movie.",0.5587806335265495
"Well the fight scenes were exciting , the story was incredibly slow. Not the best Marvel movie but not as weak as movies like Thor: The Dark World. Some of the best visuals in any movie I have seen which helps improve the overall experience. Keep an eye out for a fun character to pop up as well!",0.5534672047562532
"The best aspects of this movie is hand to hand combats(without the rings) and Simu Liu is awesome in it and embraces the character. The story is good if consider standalone which it is but I have problems with other aspects of movie elements. The entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (Marvel is doing such things for last many movies e.g, the last 2 Avengers movies). It is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx. Still remember the first Iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world. The movie is forcing the humours too in some cases. In some case they tried to mimic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but I think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator. The music of the movie is good. Overall it's a good movie. I am going to give any special attention for other upcoming marvel movies( Maybe because I left behind my fantasy world). I think there will not be any 'Classic' from marvel in upcoming future.",0.5466298864597301
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest comic-book inspired action-fantasy film from Marvel-Disney Studios. Daniel Destin Crettin is the director.The film stars Simu Liu (Canadian television's ""Kim's Convenience"") as the title character. Known as Shaun in the beginning of the narrative, he's a late-20-something who works as a valet at a San Francisco hotel with his carefree best friend Katy (Nora ""Awkwafina"" Lum). Seemingly okay with eking by earning a working-class living, Shaun's life changes when he receives a mysterious postcard. The next day a group of hitmen attack him on a bus, forcing him to reveal his potent martial arts prowess.Turns out, ""Shaun"" was born to Wenwu (veteran Chinese cinema star Tony Leung), a crime boss in China whose career has literally lasted centuries, thanks to a mysterious set of rings worn around his lower arms that grant magic powers-- including, apparently, immortality. Shang Chi's mother Ying Li (Fala Chen) was a resident of a mysterious, magical Chinese city-- think Shangri-La or Black Panther's Wakanda. Possessing her own magic-inspired martial arts skills, she convinced Wenwu to temporarily leave behind his crime empire and start a family. It didn't last, leading to a family tragedy and Shang's self-imposed exile in America.The plot has to do with Wenwu's insistence on bringing Shang and his sister Xialing (Menger Zhang) back into the family fold, so they can collectively find the entrance to the mystic city, conquer the inhabitants and reunite with Ying Li, who Wenwu insists whispers to him from beyond the grave. Shang and Xialing want nothing to do with their father's criminal empire, but Wenwu is not above brutality to convince cooperation.The film takes dramatic liberties with the original source material. Part of this is legally necessary, as the comic book Shang Chi's father was originally Yellow Peril villain Fu Manchu-- officially owned by the Sax Rohmer estate. Additionally, the original comics posed Shang as an agent of Great Britain's MI-6, with a mostly British supporting cast, including someone who ""playfully"" would refer to Shang as (an ethnic slur for Chinese/Asians). All of that backdrop is wisely eschewed for an all new set of allies and adversaries. Katy provides comic relief and as a low-key audience stand-in. As a 2nd-generation child of immigrants she also highlights the vantage point of someone who is very ""Americanized"" who bristles at ""old school values and customs"" of her parents/grandparents but striggles to fulfill her own pathway in life.Simu Liu gives a solid journeyman's performance as Shang Chi. He handles the action as well as the dramatic and comedic components. Still, it's something of a role that's semi-mired in exposition, because viewers mainly get to see his younger life in flashbacks.The action is well choreographed, including ballet-like scenes of combat and courtship alike, with nods to fantasy physics but never egregiously outlandish. The film also has beautiful cinematography courtesy of Bill Pope (his cinematography credits include 'The Matrix' and the first three 'Spider-Man' films).Possibly the most fully realized performance is that of Tony Leung, who gets to portray a more in-depth villain than is typically featured in most comic book movies. There are other solid supporting roles played by Michelle Yeoh and Sir Ben Kingsley.The climax of the film is filled with special-effects-based wonders including creatures of all sorts and Mulan-style fights between army legions. This can get dizzying for the non-comics-steeped layperson, so this may be overwhelming for some viewers. But the overall narrative is satisfying.The film takes place independent of any particular goings-in in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it is only a post-credits coda that links it to the greater Marvel pantheon. This film can be enjoyed by itself without watching any of the ""Avengers"" franchises.It remains to be seen whether ""Legend of the Ten Rings"" makes the Shang Chi character a household name alongside Captain America, Iron Man and the Rest but it is more than a worthy entry to the current phase of the Marvel movie saga.",0.5350716367236388
"I watched this movie after Twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever, so I went with high expectations, after watching what I found is movie was mediocre at best, the CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, I didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema.",0.5312573031241424
"Shang-Chi is fantastic, it's like a Bruce Lee movie meets a Marvel movie. One of the better Marvel movies. I love that they brought back Ben Kingsley to play Trevor, which he was one of my favorite characters in this movie and it is fixing his character as the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. I love that Ben Kingsley knows that most people didn't like him as the Mandarin. The insistence Planet of the Apes is played by real Monkeys is hilarious. I love the Mandarin in this movie he was my favorite character in this movie besides, Morris, Morris is the best character ever. Morris is great. The Mandarin in this movie is one of my favorite Marvel villains ever. The Ten Rings are very interesting. The bus scene at the beginning is awesome. The opening scene was also quite good. The fighting and the choreography is very well done. The dragons are very cool looking and them fighting was cool. It was nice to see Wong in this and it was nice to see him fight the Abomination. The action scenes are really cool and Simu Liu is great as Shang-Chi. I really like his character a lot and his acting is quite good. I really like the plot, it is simple but I really enjoyed it. Meng' er Zhang is good as Xialing as well. My biggest flaw is Awkwafina, she isn't as bad in this as she was in Raya and the Last Dragon and she is funny in this some of the time but I just don't think I like her very much. It will be cool to see Shang-Chi return in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. I really enjoyed this and it was one of the better Marvel movies.",0.5290312439950443
"It was great to see one of the many MCU martial artist in live action and actually living up to their comic character (Iron Fist Netflix series blows btw). The fight scenes were fantastic along with the other action sequences. Most of the characters were easy to sympathize with and the cameos were great.The only thing I personally felt that didn't go over very well was Aquifina's performance and comedic lines. It felt a little flat and I thought Ben Kingsley was way more funny than her. If it wasn't for the fact she shot the evil soul sucker in the throat saving Shang Chi and his sister, you could have left her out or played her character without all of the comedic misses and it would have been fine.As mentioned however my son and liked the movie and it provided a nice lead in to the next big bad guy of the MCU (maybe Mephisto?). Definitely worth a watch in opinion.",0.5278118517486128
"The action is the movie's biggest selling point. The hand to hand combat is done exceptionally well and the use of the environment and camera movement added to the flow and intensity of each scene.Character development and interactions is also fine. The only criticism I have is how the final fight got a bit too CGI-heavy. It really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to. It kind of just felt like the higher-ups said a Marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded.Other than this, and the fact that a side character was able to pull a MVP hit out of thin air, the movie is very enjoyable. There is some truly breathtaking scenes and there's plenty of memorable martial arts scenes to go around. Growing up with these kung fu movies, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",0.5232506670922109
"At first glance, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is emotional, engaging and action packed. The truth is that there's so much more behind the surface. It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and dynamic choreography. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. The director, Destin Daniel Cretton, manages to create a new mythology, both inspired by the comics and the Chinese tradition. The visual effects are great, even outstanding during certain moments, as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures. Finally, the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes, especially when there's more action and emotion. A new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches. This movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves, once again, the endless possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to offer.",0.5227306521916103
"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about. But let me say this, it competes with the Avengers movies when comes to cinematography, visuals and action sequences.By far the best Marvel movie in the recent years, that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame.The visuals are a blast, a true eye candy experience. There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen. I think it's mandatory to watch Shang-Chi on the biggest screen you can get to.",0.520867934996033
"I'm super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that. After seeing ""Black Widow"" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I'm now confident that isn't the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn't let up in either category going forward. I can't believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn't have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There's even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It's a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you'll have.",0.520867934996033
"Shang Chi movie review-
Some spoilers
Pros:
The story. I thought this movie would be boring just because it's a character that I am completely unfamiliar with but it actually was very interesting. Not just the plot but the origin and the backstory on peoples lives, I really loved the idea of it all. It incorporated a lot of cool Asian culture as well as some hip-hop American vibes and culture too. It was a very awesome combination.The characters you don't see in the trailer. One of the main characters is Shang-Chi's sister, the girl with the short hair and bangs (left in picture). She is by far the coolest character in this entire movie and I don't know WHY she is not on the front of more posters and more trailers! Katy played by Awkwafina isn't just the person in the movie that's the comedy, there are others too and although she is funny she actually has a lot more depth to her character and does have some serious moments, she's in the whole movie. I liked her more than I thought I would.The fight scenes and action. Shang Chi (Shaun) is extremely skilled in Kung Fu and actually has a fighting style similar to Batman. If he had a cape it would be awesome, but I know his character doesn't need it. There are very cool scenes that reminded me of scenes in Wakanda but in a mystical Asian land where there are dragons and other cool fictional creatures. The sets are beautiful!Some cameos and also the music. I won't spoil anything but there are some pretty cool cameos in this movie that definitely set up the world of the Marvel universe. Although the one cameo we'd all love to see we cannot. RIP Stan Lee. This film actually had some really cool music, the main character actually sings a song or two on the soundtrack as well as some really cool hip-hop music. I suggest to go check it out!Cons:Some plot holes. There were some moments were I got confused with some of the details of the plot. There were things that were not answered you have to figure out on your own. It's good to go to the movies with people so that you can talk about it afterwards and catch things. It is one of those movies where you may have to see it again to catch some things that you missed. I wish they made it a little bit more clear.The weird friendship between Katy and Shaun. In the movie you see that the two leads are BEST friends, they work together. But in the real world that is not very realistic. They kind of hint that there may be something that comes of it, some moments where I totally thought it was going to be romantic. I just wish they would either make it romantic or not, not somewhere in between. I'm sure there will be more movies where they may make them a couple eventually.The Mandarin. For those of you who don't know, that is the father of Shang Chi and Xialing (the real one not the drunk one on Iron Man 3). He is a very tough man, a villain. I don't like the aspect of making his father the villain even though that's the way I'm sure it is in the comic books. It just seems sad and not a good story that his dad sucks. I wish Marvel had some more Mufasas.All in all though it was great! Stay for all the credits there's two! It was better than I thought.8/10.",0.5141332700433177
"Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.My Rating: 8.6/10.",0.5123033267742668
"I absolutely loved the first Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, but since then, most of the movies have just fell flat for me. Shang-Chi on the other hand is exactly what I'd be hoping for. No overly complicated story lines with too many plot holes to count. This has great character development with people you actually feel sympathy for. Natural comedic relief throughout. Amazing fight scenes and fairly constant action without feeling forced. This is just a great super hero movie all around.",0.5068805698149004
The Marvel Studios once again makes a movie that uses jokes instead of making a good character development.,0.5068805698149004
"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!",0.5061791190307967
"I had very high expectations and Shang-Chi still blew me away. Definitely the best Marvel movie to date, the story was great. The villain wasn't boring and didn't have lame motives, the characters were well written, the music was fantastic and the fight scenes and special effects were amazing. It's also a very easy movie to understand and enjoy if you aren't very well versed in Marvel movies as it's Shang-Chi's introductory movie. Highly recommend.",0.4995063049770855
"I was worried this movie would be a bust but it was SO much better than Black Widow AND had some great fight scenes. Though it's not my favorite Marvel movie of all time (I am a huge Marvel fan), I found it to be a decent action movie and a pretty good plot for a Marvel origin story.Tony (The Mandarin) was freaking AMAZING, some of the best acting I've seen in a Marvel movie and by far the best actor in the movie. Akwafina surprised me as I thought she was an odd casting choice but her and Simu had great on chemistry on set. Also shout out to WONG the OG Asian marvel superhero.Definitely see this movie!!!!!",0.4995063049770855
This movie is very amazing. The special effect and martial arts stunt are very beautiful. This is one the best movie from Marvel. A must to see the movie 2 times.,0.4995063049770855
"Tony Leung and Fala Chen was the standouts in this movie (in my own humble opinion). Something about their performances struck a chord with me and those two really got me into this movieThe movie is a fun action/fantasy ride, some cool shots and set pieces but it also suffers from those boring PG-13 fights most of the time, it got kind of gritty at some parts which was very welcome.Simu Liu and Awkwafinas relationship felt a little ""manufactured"" at first like there was no chemistry there but it got better as the movie went along, maybe their first scenes together were among the first being shot?The CGI was not the best, at some places it was painfully obvious where they've added CG when you kind of didn't need it and a practical effect or prop could have been used and that is something the MCU doesn't do too well overall.Another thing I really, really liked was the fact that there was more chinese spoken than I anticipated, that always ruins movies/shows/games when everyone speaks English to one another (even if they are in this case Chinese or whatever the setting may be).But, despite the fact that there was more Chinese spoken than I anticipated there was also a whole lot of English spoken solely between characters that aren't native English speakers. For example between Shang-Chi and Wenwu during their final fight, it's just those two no Americans or other around.",0.4995063049770854
I loved the family narrative in this movie. Probably my favorite family in the mcu. The action scenes are very good and it was visually stunningThe thing that drags this movie down so much for me is that it introduces things and shows us things in a very messy way. I really want to love this movie but I can't. The soul suckers really messed up the story IMO. I feel like all the concepts introduced are very good but they aren't presented in the best way.,0.4995063049770854
"Let me start off by saying that this film is a nice blend of spider-man, and ant-man, when you look at the personality and humor of the characters. But in a way, this is honestly every marvel movie in one. The visuals are reminiscent of dr strange, the humor is quite like ragnarok, and the characters and backstory is just fantastic. A great movie to watch with your family, but it's also great for marvel fans. Maybe one of the best marvel superhero origin stories. The pacing is decent, and the visuals are phenomenal. And you'll be happy with all the little easter eggs and extras. This is a very fun movie, it's not too dark, and i can recommend this for every marvel fan out there, it's definitely worth the watch. You will not be to disappointed.",0.4995063049770854
"Best action and sci fi movie ever. Pliz go and watch this movie, it's one of the finest movie of marvel, marvel do good job.",0.49950630497708537
"That was a freakin' blast! The story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the MCU and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of Shang-Chi.The whole cast is amazing, I mean there is so much chemistry between them. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are phenomenal in their respective roles. The Mandarin tho...so well created character.The movie is amazing bridge between East and West culture. There is so much to explore, much like Wakanda. The history of Shang's culture is so rich.The fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts...in a good way. I mean this is something completely new for the MCU and they deliver it again! Everything looks so goddamn good and I can't help myself thinking about some scenes! Also, the colors, the effects, the camera work and etc. Everything is magnificent.There is humor for sure, but there is also emotional impact. This is not some bland action packed movie, it's made with heart from fans for the fans. Kudos to the director Destin Cretton!Killer soundtrack and the main song for the movie ""Run It"" fits so good with all.There are a few surprises, that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man...just wait to see them.About the credit scenes...they are two, both are good, but one of them is...SICK!For sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema, so much story building, details, action, fun. The people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it.",0.4987714238029566
"A refreshing return to theatre going normalcy! The movie feels different from the previous Marvel movies and while I had low to no expectations from this movie, I was Iron Man'ed into falling in love with this movie and the character that AI formerly knew little about. The action was awesome the visuals both practical and CG were awesome and the story wasn't over complicated or too simple. Saw it with friends and we enjoyed it start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina have great chemistry and Tony Leung Chiu-wai is very relatable and relatable as a villain and person. Over all I love the movie the most for feeling both down to earth and human while also being full Marvel wonder. Like Iron Man, the way it opens a wide and beautiful future for Marvel leaves me optimistic and excited.",0.4987714238029566
"This movie had it all. It had great action and humor (which you would expect from a Marvel movie), but it was also so well-layered with complex characters, compelling themes, and respect for Asian culture. I found myself laughing and crying at this movie. I also loved the guest appearance from an old character long forgotten and some amazing creatures. This movie deserves all the praise it can get.",0.4987714238029566
"Well here's my review. After just reading the reviews on here I came across some bad reviews and laughed at them. Most of them are saying the villain was bad (not a spoiler: his dad) or they are saying it doesn't fit in the new marvel universe. I also saw one review who gave a 1/10 and said it was because of one of the actors in the post credits scene. For the people who are reviewing bad reviews don't like a new superheroes being Asian.The movie was a perfect it made you feel sorrow for the character and the position he was in between his father. You could feel the weight he had on his shoulders. The beginning of the movie starts with the fear of unknown, you don't know who is after him. You go through many happy and sad emotions. The movie also did a excellent job using the characters native language. The fight scenes are astonishing and the cgi was beautiful. The wasn't any cgi characters that didn't look real. The cast and crew should be proud of a beautiful masterpiece they made. Amazing amazing!",0.49865992599985237
Just watched the movie and i am speechless. The fight scenes were absolutely perfect and made my jaw drop. The character's were perfect and the little bit of comedy that was added made the movie even more amazing. If i could watch this movie again for the first time i would because the experience was out of this world.,0.49865992599985237
"I watched a few Marvel movies for the humor and action, and they were never ""great"" movies to me, so I was expecting to like it but nothing else.In the first few minutes the narrator only speaks Chinese with subtitles, which is a change from the usual immediate switch to English. At the first fighting scene I noticed how cool the music was, It's a bit like dubstep? But it really works with the scenery. Morgan Freeman's small role made me laugh, I didn't expect him there.I was also not expecting to see some things that were slightly mentioned during the movie, I really thought they were gonna keep it mysterious even though it's Marvel.I'm glad the comic relief characters weren't all there all the time, weren't the only ones being funny, and more importantly played a big role in the story. That was very pleasant.Of course the acting was great too, and the sad scenes were believable. I rarely see a main character tearing up. I wish they could cry like a normal human would. A lot of movies suffer from the badass-blank-face protagonist, this wasn't totally the case here.Big pro is the lack of forced romance, kissing and whatever. I hate that stuff. The girl always falls in love with the guy but not here (or it's not shown). Though the parents shouldn't have fallen in love either by my standards
The only bit of blood in the movie was really fake looking, but the other 3D animated made up for itOne thing I'm not happy about is how confusing some action scenes are. No idea what's going on, or where the protagonist is going. It slows down for the important hits, but those are typical Marvel action scenes.I also didn't like that the sister was overshadowed and that she forgave so easily.This is closer to a 10 than a 9 so I gave 10. I'm just so happy I felt something while watching a movie. It's been so long!",0.4986599259998523
"If you are like me, from the previews and ads you thought this was a Kung Fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire. Not an awful plot but not that original either. That is absolutely NOT what this movie is about. I love and hate that Marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and I am glad they are doing it again. That is not at all what this movie is about and I will not spoil anything.The performances are good, the story is good and while not complicated, it keeps your interest. Funny parts, touching parts, action parts, it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. It is not one of the best Marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater.",0.49756689564171735
"The VFX and CGI of this movies were both great and the best in a debut movie in my point of view, the action scenes were so good even my father who didn't wanted to see the movie loved it.And the movie is purely family friendly.Overall I really liked the movie, it made a lot of new fans of the MCU community.",0.49756689564171735
"Shang chi is really a fantastic film,reached the expectations very well. Absolutely there is no DOUT,this movie would be one of the Best ACTION film in MCU. This movie has so much of action that we never experienced in MCU quite often. It is purely entertaining for the starting to the end. I would say everyone should watch this movie in theaters and experience the action and the music(bgm) was so awesome😍.THIS MOVIE 🎥 IS GOING TO BRING NEW ERA OF SUPERHERO.",0.49756689564171735
"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong CinemaThe flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!",0.4972518986291354
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.",0.49611501293276544
"Don't believe the praise for this movie. Marvel fans who liked it have got to be kidding. They always trash DC movies but they liked this? I don't get it. But then that is typical coming from Marvel fans. It is not the Shang Chi I remember from the 70's comics. It would have been better if It took place in the 70's and had more of an Enter The Dragon vibe. What we get is anything but. It has some good action scenes, the best being with Shang fighting men on a bus. But then it has Ben Kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called Morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie. It's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an Ewok or Gizmo from Gremlins. So dumb. There are some amusing moments but then I find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments. Like most Marvel films. Give it a break. Please. The ending is something out of a Rodan, Godzilla movie. When watching this I thought is this really a Marvel movie or a B movie from made in Japan. I did like the first half of Shang Chi. The second half was just ok. I saw it free because I had a free ticket from my club card. I'm glad I did. Even when I saw the trailer I wasn't expecting anything. I can see why. My opinion is to see this on tv. It is not one of Marvel's best. And those who praise it and say that it is are kidding themselves. Gimme a break.",0.4955159040012646
"I have to agree with another reviewer here...it's probably the least Marvel of all the Marvel movies. Had it been edited to a certain effect, one would not be able to discern it as a Marvel film.It's a background story of Shang-Chi obviously, but in a way, I felt like Tony Leung stole a bit of the show. It's his anguish that drives the film, as without it, there wouldn't be a conflict between him and Shang. Seeing Tony onscreen after so many years makes me want to go on a Tony Leung marathon, or at least watch Hard-Boiled again. He's always been so good at conveying emotion without words.Michelle Yeoh has small part in the film, but as always, she kicks ass and more or less plays the same exact role she played in the recent Gunpowder Milkshake as the older, wise Auntie.Simu Liu and Awkwafina have good chemistry in the film, but I actually felt like their characters otherwise were a little bit flat, as there was not much time spent on character development. Or at least in the character of Shang, alot of time devoted to flashbacks but little time spent with Simu in the present day, fleshing out his character. They seem like they would be fun people to hang out with? Awkwafina is vital to a plot moment, but otherwise, she has little presence other than a few small comedic moments but maybe that is enough.Morris is cute. I need to find that stuffed animal...The special effects are fun to watch and colorful.The plot is a bit simplistic, as it usually is with Marvel films. It's serviceable enough, but the film starts to fall apart during last 1/3-1/4 of the film when the fantastical elements show up and certain things happen that don't quite make any sense (or at least I haven't worked out why they should make sense). The fantasy elements don't quite work as well as just watching all the fight choreography from the earlier parts of the film, it's just not as interesting to me personally.All in all, a good time and a great prelude to a Labor Day weekend!",0.49411084361652924
"As an Asian-American, I am no stranger to the cliche martial art scenes and corniness of it all. I went in fully expecting everything about this movie to be cheesy and cliche like Mulan was. Boy, was I wrong! Shang-Chi was so beautifully written, acted, and directed! I really want to give a huge shout out to the directors for their incorporation of Asian culture into this movie without making everything a cliche or a punch-line. I teared up watching people who looked like me be the main actors on a big screen and not the punch-line of a joke.Now, onto the story, the story was alright. It wasn't the best, but it's an introductory movie to the hero so not much to expect there other than your typical hero introductory tropes.The OST's of this movie were off the charts! I really enjoyed the music they had and think they nailed it.Need I say more about the acting? Tony Leung, Sima Liu, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh...These are the best of the best for Asian American actors and they nailed every scene they had in the movie!Lastly, I absolutely loved the cinematography and the fight scenes. They were well thought out and choreographed. It didn't seem cheesy or corny. Thank you Marvel for making this movie and paying homage to Asian Americans. This movie will be one that I will never forget!",0.49304680275544605
"WOW! This movie wasn't bad at all...-the action fight scene was a mixture of classical chinese martial arts choreography as flying & floating around as some 1970s classic chinese kung fu movies like hidden dragon, crounching tiger & jet li's once upon a time in china with also realistic fighting style as well as jackie chan fighting style with a mixture of fantasy magic power of fighting style like ""dragon ball-Z"" lol.-the romance scene was soo beautiful with both shang-chi mother & father a better romance movie than other marvel superhero movie lol.-the landscapes & background graphics were so amazing well done! It is soo enjoying to see a beautiful landscapes of grass, trees, & with chinese mythology creatures.-the funny scene was really enjoyable to watch with mostly KATY !! Shang-chi close friend lol.-the storyline was 4 main character was SHANG-CHI, XIALING, WENWU, & JIANG LI. It was a very well done well written story line plot of these 4 main characters by showing flashbacks to the past of what had happened to these 4 characters.-the script was well done some had some serious scripts as WENWU,XIALING & SHANG-CHI but only 2 has the funny scripts as KATY & TREVOR SLATTERY! Lmao.-2 villains that work for WENWU was very well done made with their own job to do which was Razor-fist & Death dealer...-the most sad drama part was shang-chi father being stuck in the past with his wife that died long ago. Its was heart felt as heart broken... :-(the 2 BIG REASON why i gave this movie a (9 out of 10!) It is because 1! I wish the movie shows how shang-chi father WENWU! How he FOUND THE 10 RINGS of power as in the marvels comic book!!! In the comic book the story of shang-chi father FOUNDED THE 10 RINGS in a landing crashed ALIEN SPACE-SHIP across china thousands of years ago that crashed into a village mountain in china & 2! I wish marvel show the history of the 10 RINGS criminal organization as a flashback in iron man 1 to iron man 3....",0.4920969329592739
"This movie is not for everyone.I would like to preface this by saying that I was really thrilled to have an Asian superhero on the big screen. The trailers looked fantastic and I was hoping Marvel/Disney could supplement the visuals and fight choreographies with a good storyline well set into the preexisting MCU.Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.The visuals are stunning as expected. The fight scenes are great too. But the story is a mixed bag.It starts off as a family drama between Shang-Chi, his father and his sister. That would all be good and indeed it was, I really enjoyed the first half or so of the movie. Even despite the main villain (or supposedly the main one at that point in the story) being a bit bland in my opinion, certainly for a 1000-year-old conqueror and mastermind wielding incredibly powerful artifacts of unknown origin (sidenote: the rings turn out to not do much beside being hurled at enemies like projectiles with cool light effects; in other words their powers are really not explored or represented well at all).The second half (when they discover the mystical village) is when things go absolutely bonkers. If the story kept revolving around the family of the protagonist, it would be all good. But for whatever reason someone decided to throw a complete oddball into the movie in a form of soul-eating demons (?) which, without much explanation or backstory (the only thing we know about them is that they exist), instantly assume the role of the main bad against whom everyone (including the previous main villain and his henchmen) must fight. At this point I was just sitting there amazed by the visuals and absolutely confused by what was actually happening as I wasn't sure if the main fight was Shang-Chi against his dad, Shang-Chi against the soul-eating demon, The Great Protector dragon against the demon, Shang-Chi, his sister and his friend Katy against the demon...you get the point.The camoes of other MCU characters also felt forced. Wong was fighting Abomination, sure, but why? We never find out and it's hinted that they are actually pals. Does that mean Secretary Ross just occasionally misplaces Abomination for friendly sparring with a sorcerer then? Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner also appear, briefly examining the rings which apparently have some kind of a beacon in them. Again, completely out of nowhere but perhaps a promise for the next movie where we might actually find our what the hell is going on with these things (which again seem only as a collection of cool deadly mini frisbees in the movie).Am I glad that I went to watch it in a cinema? Yes. Do I think the character has a lot of potential for the future movies? Absolutely. But as of right now, Shang-Chi has been one of the most underwhelming introductions of a new superhero within the MCU to date.",0.49209693295927387

Then, get this, its got a 'full-blown dollop of Narnia' thrown in there for good measure, at that. To be -Really- honest, it felt a bit disorienting , -At First- , seeing all ""those types of elements"" in an 'MCU' ( 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' ) picture, but then I suddenly realized that 'Infinity War' -And- 'Endgame' both -Very- prominently feature, well ...{ a walking, -""Talking""- demolition derby of a, err, -""Raccoon""- }... in them, & I began to feel at home again, pretty darn quick.2.

"Shang Chi is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Destin Daniel Cretton creates a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for the villain, Mandarin . Shang Chi is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking and one of the best action set pieces of this year which is the bus scene.",0.48593707070060344
I have witnessed something way beyond my expectations. This movie is fully action packed and well directed. Surely this is best part 1 movie of any franchise.,0.48593707070060344
"Probably the best MCU origin movie since Gaurdians. Great martial arts action too. No shaky cam! The fight scenes are reminiscent if the older Jackie Chan movies of the 90s, which makes sense since his choreographer and crew worked on this movie.",0.48593707070060344
"Movie was amazing!! The best movie in mcu, better than endgame. Jorge Es mierda.",0.4859370707006034
"As an Asian, this movie hit me in the feels hard...All the cast and team members did a stupendous job from visual effects to martial arts action. What else to expect from Marvel? Best movie of 2021 so far. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏",0.4859370707006034
"Watch it it's very good. It has the best fight scenes in any marvel movie ever with cgi on such a huge scale you would think it was an avengers movie. The music could be better as it lacks in that, but the action and the characters make up for it.",0.4859370707006034
"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is absolutely on my list of favorite Marvel movies. 2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately left me disappointed, but this one lives up to every bit of its hype.The action from beginning to end was some of the best I've seen in a Marvel movie or in general in a very long time. The choreography, especially when performed by Michelle Yeoh, Meng'er Zhang, and Fala Chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion. Everything was done with so much grace and elegance that I did not want it to end. Simu Liu brought both charisma and charm as Shang-Chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too. He was nothing short of fitting for the role. And to my surprise ""Awkwafina"" was not as unbearable as I assumed she would be.The movie does lose some momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story, but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle. The set and CGI used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film.Marvel fan or not this film is worth going to see.",0.4859370707006034
"As an Asian American, it is so excited to see a new series on Asian characters. Thank you Marvel!This could be the best visual representation of Kongfu among Hollywood movies, especially the part between Shang-Chi's dad and mom.The music is amazing too.I wish the understanding to Asian culture could have been deeper tho.For example, when the history was introduced by Shangchi's Aunty, it was wooden sculpture used to visually present it. But in ancient China, when good things are documented, they were carved on stone monument and when bad things happened, they were documented in books.The essence about Yin-Yang, why Shang Chi's mom could easily handle his father's 10 rings Kong fu, was not presented clearly at all. It's a lot more than 'knowing who you are'.When I checked out writers, I think understood why. I guess at least there could have been a consultant who understood those part to help drafting the story details, because those are real gems from Asian culture and it was deep wisdom.But, these did not block me from enjoying the movie. It was a blast watching it, even for someone who grew up watching KongFu movie.",0.4859370707006034
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings tells the story of Shaun/Shang-Chi(Simu Liu). Shang-Chi is an expert of Kung Fu. He is forced to deal with his past, when he's pursued by the Ten Rings organization.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! Director Destin Daniel Cretton has given us one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best origin stories. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. It's awesome to finally see the Kung Fu fighting style, utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. Simu Liu is spectacular as Shaun/Shang-Chi. Liu easily balances the action, dramatic scenes & the Marvel Cinematic Universe's trademark humor. Can't wait to see more of him in the future. Awkwafina is hysterical as Katy. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is outstanding as Xu Wenwu. Meng'er Zhang is fantastic as Xialing. Fala Chen is brilliant as Li. Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Ying Nan. Florian Munteanu is superb as Razor Fist. The supporting cast is amazing. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & superhero film buffs. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Can't wait for Eternals(2021)!",0.4832110213885348
"The movie's CGI and action sequences were top tier, but the story and writing, the most important parts of a film, were predictable and simplistic.Character motives were shallow and stereotypical and I was not emotionally invested in the family or any individual character. Once you understand that the movie is about family, which you can pick up right away, the plot, conflicts, and resolution are entirely predictable.The movie had its classic Marvel funny moments (diffusing tense moments with surprising humor), but I cringed in plenty of scenes too. This movie had a poor ending with little emotional catharsis. The ultimate conflict was resolved with CGI, magic, and deus ex machinas, like the average action blockbuster, which might have been acceptable if it had emotional depth or moral complexity, but it didn't.Overall, the movie was a typical superhero film about family bonds with Kung Fu and dragons. As much as I love the Chinese representation, as I am Chinese, the movie itself was disappointing.",0.48313890386945374
"Amazing CGI,story, beginning of a new character and absolutely amazing credit shot
In this movie every second your are going to open your mouth and surprised
Good luck for the fourth stage, This movie raised my expectations for other works, I pray they don't drop again.",0.4827863033813542
"After a brief gap of theatrical release (not considering Black Widow as it had a partial release), MARVEL is back in theatres introducing to the characters of the new phase of their universe. Shang Chi The Legend Of Ten Rings is a standalone film but equally also serves as an important piece of puzzle in the events linking to the web series' and upcoming movies. It goes without saying that watching all the recently released series on Disney+ is as important as following these movies in order.As the trailer shows and also the name suggests Shang Chi is a movie whose action heavily lean towards the martial arts and individual battles. It is a different watch as compared to other MARVEL movies which involve a lot of hi tech dependent action. The movie hardly wastes any time on the lead character's introduction and straightway jumps into the 'purpose'. Having experienced the 'blip' after the infinity war, the normal people aren't surprised anymore when supernatural things and high octane action happens around them. Hence the character here is hardly wasting any time on hiding their identities from the public. The storyline is pretty straightforward and the movie has strong resemblance to Black Panther because of the lead character's connection to his place of origin. The action sequences are shot brilliantly and some of the camera and lighting work is mind blowing. The movie relies on good hand to hand combat almost until the climax and I believe if MARVEL had gone for an R rating, the action sequences would have been much better to watch. I personally think some incidents happening around climax were way too convenient. Last but not the least, the background music just elevates most scenes into a whole new level.Simu Liu has what it takes to bring the Asian heritage to the superhero universe. The movie doesn't test much of his emotional side and I believe we will get to see more in the upcoming movies. Tony Leung shines in his powerful antagonist role and Awkwafina drives the comical side of things as Shang Chi's close buddy who is almost a sidekick. Rest of the cast have done a decent job and do look out for a surprise funny cameo ;-)MARVEL expands its universe with Shang Chi by exploring a different culture and heritage in the superhero genre. It is a satisfying watch for a MARVEL fan and a great watch for any action movie fans.",0.48278630338135414
"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust.",0.48278630338135414
"The cinematographie can make this a masterpiece. I just really love the character writing of everyone in this movie , you can easily understand each character because you get to see caused there motivation. And of course the way they used the Chinese language in this movie it fits the movie perfectly and pulls you into the story. Overal a really funny visual pleasing and enjoyable movie.",0.4827863033813541
"Black widow was a really good movie, but this is what marvel is all about! Amazing storyline, phenomenal action, and just the right amount of humor. This movie was an epic introduction to a character that I was previously unfamiliar with. The future is bright in the MCU.",0.48278630338135403
"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.",0.48278630338135403
"This film had some very funny and unique moments in it, but overall I think the story was quite weak and there weren't any moments where I was fully into the movie. I think sequels could have good potential but I left the cinema without much excitement. Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but there are so many marvel films that top this one in storyline and character developed ect. I think 6 is a reasonable score I would give 6.5 if this were an option but 7 is a bit generous. Don't believe these 10/10 reviews. 10 is reserved for cinematic masterpieces like the dark night or infinity war.",0.48278630338135403
"I have to that this movie was great. It has a lot of action in this movie and the choreography in every fight scenes was amazing. Also, the story was interesting and it has a lot of jokes that makes me laugh every time and the CGI and the visual of this movie was great. This movie was very entertaining. This is probably the best MCU solo movie after captain america the winter soldier.Overall, I gave it 8/10 because it was a great action movie. I like it😁👍",0.47980068286776184
"Shang chi is One of the Best Solo movie till now in Marvel. If you are waiting to come it on OTT platform , you are gonna regret for not watching it in Theaters,(unless due to Covid-19) .Visuals are so much OP in this movie. BGM of this movie will give you the vibes of Kung fu panda(Chinese Instruments), with some Dj snake Officials.Martial Arts And Other Fighting Sequences are also Very Amazing in this movie.For those who are Searching a good movie after 2 years of covid, this movie is that you should watch i.t
Beware of Spoilers and you will Enjoy the movie.",0.47980068286776184
"Mannnn... this movie is good.Let me... just say.. first of all.. OMG THE FIGHTS! THE ACTION! OH.. MY.. GOD. Marvel did it again after having a slight setback with the just okay black widow movie. This movie has the best fight scenes I've seen since the raid films. The fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection. The bus fight is incredible!!!!! The fight in the beginning between the mandarin and the mother.. wow wow wow...
OKAY Back to reality. This movie does have flaws. First of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow. The score honestly is weak. Might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself.The plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot, but because of the great screenplay it works.Cinematography was amazing. The acting was good. And the special effects were very good. One thing that I have to admit. Game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of .. a particular mythical creature so... that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good.But man the fights were incredible.. the camera work was so good. Fluent movements but fast and I could see EVERYTHING. After snake eyes I thought I would never see a good martial arts movie again considering how average that was.Thank you, shang chi. You made my night.9 out of 10. Welcome back marvel.",0.4798006828677618
An absolutely amazing movie! Some of the best special effects and fight sequences you'll ever see! Definitely a must-see!,0.47801031380391973
"Watched it yesterday. Overall the movie was wonderful. MCU put everything so perfectly. The cast, visuals, CGI everything was on pinpoint. Every Characters performance was brilliant. I need to mention this because without this character the movie would not be that interesting and that role is played by Awkwafina as Katy. Her comic timing was so good. And as always marvel surprised me to have the villain as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as as Xu Wenwu. His performance was brilliant along with our new hero Simu Liu as Shang Chi.Definitely worth of time. Go watch the movie in the theatre and don't spoil.",0.4720384969433638
"The first film in the MCU's next phase was BLACK WIDOW, but that film, which featured Scarlet Johannson's swan song as the title character, felt very much like it was grounded in what had come before, but SHANG-CHI: THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS very much breaks new ground, and takes us into a heretofore only hinted at corner of the Marvel Universe. It's the origin story of the title character, a martial arts superhero, but he is not nearly as well known as Spider-Man or Captain America, so we are not treated to yet another iteration of Uncle Ben's demise. Instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family, one without easily defined villains. Shang-Chi joined the Marvel Comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the Kung Fu craze at the height of Bruce Lee's popularity. He had his own book for many years, interacting with other Marvel heroes, and if he has not been a Marvel regular in recent decades, Shang-Chi has never gone away, and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans.Like all origin movies, SHANG-CHI begins with some exposition and back story, specifically concerning his father, Wenwu, played by Tone Leung, a power hungry thousand year old immortal, who wields the Ten Rings of the title, a fearsome mystical weapon of an unknown source. Only when he meets Li, played by Fala Chen, a fighter from the hidden realm of Ta-Lo, does he find someone who is his equal in combat. Falling in love, Wenwu forsakes his violent ways, and starts a family with Li. But in every hero's origin story there must be a tragedy, and when Li is murdered by Wenwu's rivals, he seeks vengeance, becoming the villain he once was, and teaching his son and daughter how to become deadly assassins. When we meet Shang-Chi, well played by Simu Liu, he is a twenty something Chinese immigrant living in San Francisco making a living as a parking valet with his best friend/girlfriend, Katy, played by Awkwafina, having broken from his father's world. But as with most stories centering on estranged families, the plot turns on them being drawn back together, and Wenwu needs a pair of pendants belonging to Shang-Chi and his sister that were gifts from their mother because they are essential, he believes, if he is to free his deceased spouse from the Dark Realm, whose entrance lies inside Ta-Lo. And if Shang-Chi doesn't want to go along with Dad's plan, too bad. It all comes to a head in an epic battle in Ta-Lo in a CGI heavy third act - pretty much a staple for the MCU.I liked this movie because it has plenty of energy, with great well done action scenes, along with some spectacularly staged martial arts battles. It also has a lot of heart, with characters who are easy to become invested in. And this lighter touch is welcome after the dark turns of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. In Tony Leung, it has a great villain with an understandable motive, something essential with any good super hero film. Simu Liu is an appealing lead, and he's matched all the way by Awkwafina's Katy, an underachiever who discovers special skills. I am not always impressed with CGI laden film making, but I don't mind it here because I actually care about the all too human characters involved in the action. The finale in Ta-Lo is supposed to be the high point of the movie, but for me, nothing beats the battle on the careening city bus on the streets of San Francisco early in the film, where Shang-Chi first shows his true martial arts prowess against his father's minions, led by the fearsome Razor Fist, played by the physically impressive Florian Monteneau. Michelle Yeoh has a part as a village elder, and out of nowhere, Ben Kingsley returns as actor Trevor Slattery, thus redeeming what for many of us fans what was one of the more disappointing villain tweaks from IRON MAN 3.An early scene at a Hong Kong fight club firmly establishes that all this is happening in the MCU with appearances by Benedict Wong's character from DOCTOR STRANGE, and the Abomination from THE HULK. Wong returns in a post credits scene that clearly sets up Shang-Chi and Katy for the big leagues in the next phase of the MCU. Will they learn where the Ten Rings came from, and maybe does THE ETERNALS have anything to do with it? And there is the dangling plot thread of what exactly happened when Shang-Chi was sent to kill the man responsible for his mother's death when he was 14; it was the event that estranged him from his father. Something tells me we will find out in some future installment. I can hardly wait.",0.4702107935150808
"I was really looking forward to this film, and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU. It started out good with an interesting father, and son character development. As the film continued, it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI. After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming. The acting was well done, by everyone in the film no weak links. Was hoping this film, would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man.",0.4683009652074391
"So personally I'm not huge into the marvel scene so my score came as a surprise to me. The acting and character development was impressive in its own right, with a good scaling plot that never felt slow but built up like a good song.There were a few moments where the animation completely blew me away, I've seen every new film in the cinemas for the past while and plenty of animation in and out of cinema and some moments were truly incredible.Would recommend anyone to go and see this, easily my favourite action film and maybe my outright favourite film.",0.4683009652074391
"I was really looking forward to this movie. Initially, I was a bit upset that I wasn't going to be able to watch it on Disney+. However, after experiencing it on the big screen, I was so thankful I HAD to go to my local theatre to watch it. As a Chinese Australian, you rarely get to see characters that are similar to you. It was so nice to see asian experiences displayed unapologetically on the screen. The reviews that discuss how next level the martial arts are, really were telling the truth. I have seen plenty of Chinese dramas where martial arts is displayed full on & I always found myself thinking the filming direction was a bit off. This movie combined martial arts from the Chinese dramas & it was so natural and perfectly impactful. It is definitely not like the action shown in 2020's Mulan. The SFX was STUNNING, it's better than what the other Marvel movies have shown & we were just amazed at the effort and details that were placed.I'm no acting major so I don't know my stuff but I did find some of Simu Liu's facials to be a tad awkward or a little too exaggerated however, he was still, nonetheless, wonderful in this role. Tony Leung, my god, he was the moment. He really shone in this movie for me. His natural swag & cool demeanour was so attractive and I really could not hate his character. I enjoyed Awkwafina's acting in this movie, she really knows how to deliver humorous lines & I'm glad she had an impactful part in the movie & wasn't just the comedy relief.It did hurt to see that my cinema wasn't packed especially since my area is full of Asians. They may have not known about the movie since Marvel barely did any advertisement for it. I definitely hope in the future I get to see more support for Shang-Chi & the other members.Regarding the credit scenes: the mid credits scene was definitely a ""huh, that's interesting"" moment but probably not something to cause any uproar over. I'm interested to see where it goes.Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. There was so much Mandarin incorporated in the movie that I am able to take my parents to watch it too!",0.4651416754496323
"This is a beautiful movie, and it is entertaining. However the plot could not be more basic and the characters development more limited to what they could fit in between action scenes. All of this alongside some quite weird choices as to make Shaun's friend an essential character to the development of the story for future movies when she has no reason to be part of it at all, other than for being a liability... so all in all, I had a good time at the movie, but that's it. I reserve my good notes for movies that really deserve them.",0.4646407256121455
"""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies"" Movie Review (9/8/21): ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings""First, when people on IMDB rate a movie (though VERY good) a 9 or 10, I really want to ask ""So it's a 10.. the VERY BEST movie EVER.. as good as ""Sound of Music"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Oliver"", ""Star Wars"" and movies that probably DO get a 9 or 10?? To me.. YES.. an excellent movie. But people skew the ratings by calling everything a 9 or 10. With that said, I'd give it between a 7 and 8 (which is VERY good), but a little closer to a 7 (7.4).Yet another Marvel Studio (Disney) release to the Marvel Universe. I knew nothing about this movie and didn't really have a lot of interest in seeing it, but GLAD I did! It was fun.. and it was exciting! Excellent adventure movie that had great effects and great story line.If you like adventure movies.. even if you haven't followed the Marvel Universe, you really don't have to know the history of the other movies to enjoy this one.I will add the following (which is not a spoiler): Do NOT leave the movie until the very VERY last of the credits have rolled and they turn on the lights to clean the place. As the movie ends, we go into one last restaurant scene. Then in the middle of the credits, we get MORE story. Then after the last of the credits.. even after ""Marvel Studio Cleaning Crew: Bob the Janitor and Mae his wife"", we get ONE more scene at the end. These Marvel extras are consistent and basically a clue into what comes next.On a 1-10 scaled, I'd give this a very good 7.4! This is a BIG screen movie, so see it at the theater.",0.4532267322622369
"I was going in with not much fate in this movie, but i got proven wrong. Its something quite fresh and unexpected, some scenes in the first 45 minutes are a bit weak and could be preformed better, the last hour or so is the absolute best. (they could've gone into more details of the rings themselves and they might want to rethink the cast next time) The music on the other hand was okay it was the final battle where the music stood out. The cameos are crazy! I have to give full points to the hair and makeup department and the costume designs, the costumes where awesome! The movie doesn't try hard to be the best...and it doesn't need to because its already pretty good by itself!Marvel did it again!",0.44130563733646233
"Marvel, you sneaky SOBs, is there nothing - I mean NOTHING at all - that you can't
turn your hands to? I'll be the first to admit that I was very sceptical about what really amounts to a glorified Kung Fu movie finding its place in the MCU. I need not have worried. Shang Chi sits right up there with the very best Marvel has on show.Simu Liu and the ever wonderful Akwafina make a fantastic duo and the addition of the queenly Michelle Yeo and the wonderful Tony Leung is the icing on the cake. It's exciting, adventurous fun. So go see it, you definitely won't regret it!",0.4413056373364623
"Marvel Origins story are amazing but this one breaks the line. The writing, the humor, the comedy everything is perfect here. The directors made all the best choices which made the movie incredible.",0.4413056373364623
"I thought I'd like the film, but I didn't expect it to be one of my all-time favorite MCU movies! It's a mix of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and anything Jackie Chan. The action in this movie is as good as you've read, and easily the best action in any MCU film to date. Simu Liu is awesome, but the ending is so epic it's definitely worth the price of admission. As an English teacher I loved the self-aware reference to Macbeth, but the film does a fantastic job completing the hero's journey. Great job Marvel, you've done it yet again.",0.4413056373364623
"The movie provides an excellent experience for the whole family. One of the best, if not the best, origin stories in the MCU. Amazing cameos and mind-blowing action. This one is for any die-hard marvel lover or action seeker. The Actors produced some of the best on-screen performances we have ever seen in an MCU movie. Keep up the excellent work exciting times head for the super hero movie lovers.",0.4413056373364623
What a movie.. Hands down brilliant.. Thank you Marvel for giving us such a new world.. Excellent from everyone.. Simu Liu is just a star and long way to go.. Best choice for the role.,0.4413056373364623
This movie had everything from a great story to some of the best visuals I've ever seen.Shang-Chi has elevated the already high expectations from the MCU moving forward.,0.4413056373364623
"Everybody was kung fu fighting for 2 straight hours and it´s just bad.It starts okay, then it just gets worse by the minute.If this is the new direction Marvel is headed, then it´s just sad.Really a bad movie and the story is rubbish, acting is bad and the best thing is that I saw it for free.",0.4413056373364623
Awesome fights.Awesome graphics.Awesome music.Awesome 👍 movie.Music & fight sequences are the best.Personally second best solo hero movie of Marvel after Ironman.,0.4413056373364623

"I watched best movie by marvel its full cocktail with action , drama , emotion , comedy special thanks for pina and sir ben. K tony sir and the actor who ply Shangchi whol cast are superb in their role they did great work and last epic dragon vs dragon fight was Great unfortunately there are no open theater in my state so I watched it in my lptop but great experience.",0.4413056373364623
The action definitely carried this movie. The fight scenes are great. But the writing is a bit weak and the final fight (between the monsters) was kind of boring. Overall it's good fun and the best piece of Marvel entertainment since Endgame.,0.4413056373364622
A solid origin story of marvel's shang chi loved it completely don't know what's wrong with the bad reviews I guess dc fans are super sad that even shang chi over shadowed their only hope this year let's face it the suicide squad is not going to be the best movie this year in fact it's overrated in opinion.,0.4413056373364622
"A very welcomed addition to the MCU, and any Avengers to come. 'Shang-Chi' kung-fu's it's way to top tier MCU territory, especially when it comes to origin stories.Perhaps this generations 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', both of which are visual spectacles to behold. 'Shang-Chi' is full of beautiful creatures, costumes, martial arts, and acting. Probably the best fighting in the MCU, which makes sense (though Cap and Winter Soldier fighting is my personal favourite). The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well. A few appearances from other MCU characters, including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself.A refreshing Marvel superhero movie in that it primarily focuses on itself, but has tons of potential to jump right in with other Marvel storylines. The MCU still holds lots of excitement for the future with characters like Shang-Chi.",0.4413056373364622
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.",0.4413056373364622
"I loved it, and so did the boys (my 25 and 31 year old boys)! It was funny, action-packed, and there was family drama on an epic scale. There was plenty of amazing martial arts action - my favorite was the first one on a runaway bus in San Francisco with 5 assassins and our reluctant hero. Also, there were magical creatures, a tragic love story, and a battle of good and evil. My older son is always the most critical of the three of us, and he loved it. His only criticism is that it wasn't much of a Marvel movie, but as an origin story, that did not bother me. There were 2 superhero cameos, and larger parts for Wong from Dr. Strange and Ben Kingsley reprising his role (as an actor hired to play a terrorist) from the Iron Man 3. In the end, the best thing that I can say is that when we walked out, we all said that we wanted to see it again!",0.4413056373364622
Awesome! I enjoyed it a lot. Visually entertaining. This is the best from Marvel since the End Game!Asians rule! I just wish they included more cast from North East and South East Asia! It would have been an even better representation!10/10! A great labor day weekend movie treat!,0.4413056373364622
"I was never a fan of the Shang-Chi comic book, but this movie was very refreshing and amazing. Great introduction to Shang-Chi! Simu Liu is perfectly well casted. There was great chemistry between the leads, and the fight choreography is the best I've ever seen from Marvel. Great story line and action, and especially the comedy!!! Loved Awkwafina!! I can't give it 8 or 9 stars. I GIVE it a 10 star rating! Highly recommended! Watch it and you won't be disappointed.",0.4413056373364622
"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a great Marvel Studios film. The story was fun and engaging, and was surprisingly emotional, with Shang Chi's relationship with his father and sister. The father's death was surprisingly impactful, and which the movie did well. One issue with the story was that the film would take a pause with the plot for flashbacks and exposition. They do make the film boring and slow at times, but there's not many. Plus, the flashbacks can be helpful
The visuals and action scenes in this film are, in my opinion, some of the best action scenes in the MCU. The film takes advantage of the martial arts action to deliver epic fight scenes. The visuals were also stellar. The CGI was top notch, and the backgrounds were some of the best from Marvel.The Characters were all fun to watch, and throughout the movie, you feel engaged in these characters. Shang Chi and Katy's chemistry is great. The villain was a great antagonist in this film. Some characters were bland and forgettable, but the good ones shine the most throughout the film.Overall, it's a great MCU film with a compelling story, great fights and visuals, and engaging characters. IT can be a bit slow at times, but the film is a must watch. MY favorite MCU film since Far From Home.",0.4413056373364622
"Let me start by saying damnnn, Marvel made an absoluut banger of a movie. It has one of the most developed antagonist in a marvel film and the CGI is just stunning to watch, let alone a very good story and all the great fight scenes.From beginning to end I had one big smile. If this is the first film of phase 4 then I can only expect bigger things to happen.Of course if you are a marvel fan go watch it!! But also if you are not this is in my opinion the best marvel film made and definitely worth your money.Phase 4 is destined for greatness.",0.4413056373364622
"Ok, so I really liked it. In particular I really liked the characters. I loved the hero's journey that Shang Chi went on. I loved his relationship with Katy and his sister. They were all likable, and badass in their own way. And you could empathize with them. I thought this was a very strong villain. Not just physically, but very compelling. A lot of MCU villains can come across as very one note. But he was complex and layered. So that was great to see. And of course they were all strongly acted as well. Akwafina is maybe the least strongest out of the main cast (Check out The Farewell if you really want to see her shine) but like, she is still is good in this.I loved the fight choreography in this. Probably some of the best fight scenes you get in the MCU. And I loved the visuals used in those scenes as well. Some shots were truly stunning to watch.One downside I had though is that I wanted to know more about how the magic works. Like the final battle between Shang Chi and his father he has suddenly mastered his mother's magic/fighting. And I know the movie kind of pokes fun of this at the end by having Shang Chi tell his friends that he had 1 day of training. But seriously, how did that happen? Is it just because he's his mother's son? Is it because he was specifically in that place? I just needed a little more backstory/explanation. Also, the Wong/Abomination fight (which was totally spoiled in the trailers) didnt really do anything and just added more questions. I guess they needed a way to set up Wong for the mid credits scene though. And that mid credits scene in general just raised more questions for me. Like why is Bruce back to being in his human form? It clearly takes place after the events of Endgame (judging by his arm sling) so why is he not in his Professor Hulk form?I thought the comedy was good for the most part. I think it worked well with the beginning and ending of the film. But didnt always land during the more meatier parts of the film. Theres maybe a few other elements I could nitpick but for the most part I really liked this film. Im not sure where I would rank it yet. I think probably a top 10-er.",0.4413056373364622
"Despite them not promoting this a lot it was a game changer, different kind of genre and pace! They mixed and match well.The CGI out of this world, and the acting chemistry between all actors, thanks for blessing us!Best movie of this year, easily 10/10. You would be surprised with some newcomers to marvel!Be prepared to have your mind blown!!!",0.4413056373364622
"This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The hero of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience. Also the martial arts and action scenes are a treat to watch and the core of the film is about family.",0.44130563733646216
"Overall it was a pretty bland movie. The plot was uninteresting and boring. There's not as many fight scenes as you'd think. Most of the characters didn't have a lot of personality. And Shang's girlfriend was incredibly annoying.It had it's moments though. There's a certain character that brought some fun scenes to the film.It's definitely one of the lower tier marvel movies, but it was still worth watching.",0.43753872280495854
"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.",0.4375387228049585
"It's so extremely generic and made with no passion or soul in it. It's just another super generic origin story where main character is basically invincible and beats the bad guy and saves the day, so he could later join some Endgame style movie.",0.4375387228049585
"I really liked this movie and I'm a full-on marvel fan, I usually like Wanda over all the other characters, but this film makes me like Shang-Chi now too. And all this time I would have never thought I would like another character. Marvel, you have outdone yourselves for sure!",0.4375387228049585
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a visual masterpiece: Marvel not only made a very beautiful picture, but also finally worked on staging the battles!The film is very original. While watching, you dive as much as possible into Chinese culture, enjoy the mythical animals and completely forget that you are watching a movie of the MCU, remembering this only when you hear a reference or see a cameo of a character you know.As for the plot, it is very simple, straightforward and without a single plot twist. Purely a fairy tale.The humor is good overall, apart from a couple of Katie's little jokes.And Shang-Chi himself turned out to be a little faded, lost against the background of everything that was happening. But he has potential.Two post-credits scenes, one of which will amuse you a lot!8/10.",0.4375387228049584
Marvel make a awesome file in the 2021 And thier stories of the character are so deep and the VFX was just wow I love this movie.,0.4375387228049584
"This could have been a great movie, but it wasn't. It began well and ended well. Everything in between was pretty lame. Disney has the Disney plus platform where they could have built up this character since no one really knows who shang chi is. Unfortunately, Disney didn't do that so most of the minute I'm just left wondering why do I care. With so much Asian culture to pull from I wish Disney would have done more. 3 out of 10 stars. Other reviews I'm sure are paid for.",0.4375387228049584
"What a fun ride with some emotionally touching scenes. Tony Leung Chiu-wai worked hard at making his character a different kind of villain who is not stereotypical and the way he loses connection and wallows in grief is deep. You can see what is causing him to act as he does.Simu Liu carries this movie alongside Tony Leung and it's got a lot of father/son conflict which is touching to see on screen.The fight scenes are really good, the action is top notch and I liked the friendship running along in the story. Stay for the two end scenes which tease so much!",0.4375387228049584
"This movie is both fine, yet very flawed. The first issue is pacing. It's quite exhausting. Action-break-flashback-action-flashback-action-break-break-break-flashback-action. It's as if you tried to first sprint, then suddenly halt and tip-toe-walk and then run a marathon only to sprint again.Second issue are flashbacks. This movie is riddled with them. And I don't mind them.. Unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk. I don't remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks.Third issue are fights. Now this has to be broken in 2 groups; ""magical fights"" and ""down to earth fights"". The first was done terribly. Camera shake, way too close, badly lighted and confusing as heck. There was some vision, some idea, yes, but it turned into ""cgi slosh"". This could have been done oh-so-much better.. But we got pointless confusing close-ups then camera shaky-shaky moments instead. The second group reminds me of jackie chan movies, you know.. kung-fu stuff, which was great... To some extend.Fourth issue is main character. He's the extend from point earlier. He's like blank-slate punching bag in this show. He has no real emotions and just goes with the flow. He >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with. It was annoying. Really grating. Ok, I don't mind if MC is not an iron man of a character. But I had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than Shang chi. Also he gets beaten pretty much all the time. There are only 3'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions. And again.. shoddy pacing cripples them slightly.The Second character, his friend - Katey (i think).. she was fine. She was active and I couldn't shake this feeling that she's the brains of the team with witty humor, while he's broody muscle man with past.There were few amazing scenes, which i loved alot, really. But beyond that it was just mediocre. Thank god it was ""just"" mediocre, considering what things marvel relases lately. Mediocre is fine. Really. Tiresome, extended to the point of exhausting... But fine! A (not so) solid 7!Oh also, there are quite a few plot holes and whatnot ranging from minor (assassins using stun weapons ONLY - lol) to extreme (spoilery stuff).. but at this point.. i just can't even bother. Just roll my eyes and force my brain to stop thinking about it. To become a script writer in 202x all you need to know is how to sniff glue with class and how to agree to everything corporate monkeys in expensive suits tell you.Should you watch it? If Marvel fan.. you already seen it. If you aren't marvel fan, but still enjoy sci-fi/fantasy... Eh... Not like there's anything better to do I guess.",0.4375387228049584
"This movie is fabulous..
Writings for every character was brilliant. Action sequences were beyon my imagination..Worth watching...Phrase 4 begins with a blast.",0.4375387228049584
"After watching the film I realised the script didn't make that much sense and there were many errors in the writing.The acting also felt very basic and there was hardly any comedy at all, there were a few funny moments from Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) that were funny but not hilarious. There were many hilarious moments from his character in Iron Man 3 (2013).There has always been a moment in each superhero movie especially a MCU one where's there is a scene in which everyone laughs at, but not in this film.I think myself and most people will laugh at moments in films just because are friends or other auidence members are, when actually we don't find that moment in film funny ourselves.This music wasn't well timed between scenes and should have been more like Hans Zimmer's dramatic style of music, practically in the fight scenes and sentiment moments.Overall it was not that bad, the cinematography was great, and the CGI and Effects were spot on.",0.4375387228049584
"... but this is a hit. They somehow succeeded expanding the vast MCU without really forcing it (it goes to show you the richness of American pocket and world culture can go a long way). This is a solid movie, with great action sequences and CGI that delivers. Mind you, SHANG-CHI is not the same without the mesmerizing Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh (when he doesn't fight, the title character is just OK and Awkwafina still isn't funny). Do not wait to watch it on TV because you should experience it at cinema first.",0.4375387228049584
This movie is a great introduction to the character and has a pretty epic ending. Looking forward to seeing more of Shang Chi!,0.4375387228049584
"I'm a huge Marvel fan and they continue to disappoint in this phase. It's all about shallow virtue signaling and not about character anymore. Why on earth did they decide to go in this direction after Endgame? This movie had it's moments but gets lost and it's on woke lack of depth. I pray this isn't the end of the marvel cinematic universe because we all enjoyed it so much. If it is the end, it was a great 11 year run. Don't waste your time with this nonsense.",0.4375387228049584
"Smart, Funny, and Beautiful, hits the right strings with a good pace. Awkwafina's Katy really grows in the film and grows on you. Solid performances from legendary Yeoh and Leung. Although most of the movie it's easy to forget it's in the MCU, Fun callback to a previously thrown away character and also a nice bridge to known elements of the MCU. Plenty of new fare for figuring out the next phase of the MCU (and multiverse?). Two end credit scenes so stick around.",0.4375387228049584
"All I can say is ""wow"". I loved the cinematography, I was amazed by the choreography and the fact it wasn't hidden or obscured through camera angles like some previous movies, and I now love Simu Liu and think he is an incredible addition to the MCU, along with Awkwafina.The ""villain"" of the story, Wenwu, played by the amazing Tony Leung, had incredible character depth and was certainly not a stereotypical bad guy.Aside from a couple of awkward phrases, I loved everything about this movie and am so glad I was able to support it during their opening weekend. If it wasn't COVID, I would've went to see it again by now. Highly recommend.",0.43753872280495837

"The story is like trying to say a lot but all over the place. It doesn't have any genuine nature to Eastern films, it clearly shows American crowd appeasing film made just to say to Asians, ""Look we did film for you by casting all Asians and few others and an amazing story"". It fails in many aspects be it from story, or acting or visuals, but they are always expert in marketing the mediocre or sometimes even worse film as good, great so on and make money.This movie didn't have heart in right place at first instance. You don't even connect to Shang Chi's character neither anyone in the other roles. It's just feels so cookedup without genuine touch of Chinese or HK films. There is no strong theme or purpose of who is doing and what for. It all feels like we are doing this to make a character for Marvel.The Marvels' usual formulaic movies are ripping off stories and many comics too, and it looks they only could touch upon few aspects of visuals in here but overall its an average or below average film. Since it's close to post pandemic times, so everyone are eager to watch, so it helped movie to shine through.This PCness of Hollywood and American culture should shove their mindset in their A@#$ and let people do make their genuine films and accept the way it is rather then poking their nose in each films to give an mixed bag approach. They ruined Mulan doing this screwed up mindset of film making approach. I'm sure they will cover it up in Eternals, but still all these super hero movies now are so junk it seems.",0.43753872280495837
"Having worked on this film's visual effects, I can safely say that I was pleasantly surprised when watching Shang-Chi at the premiere. Up to that point, I had not actually watched the full film.This movie is bolstered by a fantastic performance from Simu Liu, who I hope will star in many other great films. His charisma alone is a good reason to like the movie. The supporting performances weren't quite as memorable, but of course, they were not bad at all. As usual, the visual effects for this film were great (and I might be a tad too self-indulgent here), as was the direction by Destin Daniel Cretton.I am very excited to see where Shang-Chi will show up next!",0.4255556003686893
"I went to the cinema to watch this movie in IMAX 3D and the money was definitely worth it. Honestly this is my favourite stand alone film in the MCU. The visual effects are outstanding, as well as the fight scenes and some good comedy though :)). I recommend everyone (not just Marvel fans) to watch this movie.",0.4193022940736819

It Was Such a Great Time.Good Story, Amazing Visuals, Good Comedy, Some Nice Fights.Also The Ten Rings in Action Were Spectacular To Watch. The Ten Rings Are Brutal.It's A Major World Event For the Official Start Of the New MCU (Black Widow is a Prequel).Overall, As A Movie It is Probably An 8 Out Of 10 but Because of the Cinematic Experience, that Changes the Game Completely.

"So you want your son to come see you and your plan is to send a team of assassins to kill/collect him? You might lose your son, lose some henchman, and reveal your organization on the internet. This is the first action sequence and one of the first overall scenes of the movie; the poor writing sets a bad tone for the rest of the movie. Your defense is you don't think your assassins could kill him; but your goons had the element of surprise and you haven't seen your son in 10 years so how could you know if he's gone soft or not. Main actor performance: C; best friend performance: D; sister performance: C; dad: C.

"PART WITH NO SPOILERS
This film was absolutely amazing! Almost every aspect of the film was perfect and it smashed my expectations and took it's place as one of the best Marvel films, or any films that I have seen.The visual effects in this movie were fabulous, there were plenty of captivating scenes with astounding usage of modern technology. The cinematography was probably one of the best I have seen in a film for a while, it kept you captivated and on your toes the entire time! I also noticed light being used to make the scenes even more captivating, which is something you don't always see in films.The dialogue was solid and didn't feel clunky or wierd, the jokes were well spaced and gave your muscles a rest from being tensed.The action was perfectly filmed and beautiful, it felt like they were dancing. The choreography was very impressive.The story itself was nothing unexpected, pretty much a generic origin story, but don't worry that doesn't take away from the film at all!And lastly the villain was for me one of the most interesting aspects of the film, they made you feel for him and gave him an interesting charachter with a non-generic motive, I haven't felt for a villain this much for a long while.PS: There are two post credit scenes so stay after the credits.PART WITH SPOILERS
And I just wanted to say I loved the return of Trevvor Slattery! It was such a surprise and something they managed to keep out of the trailers, he was hilarious especially where he played dead. Also I like the fact Wong played a role in the film, the scenes with him were interesting. The post credit scenes set up the sequel which I will be very interested to see! Can't wait to find out what the sister does and who the rings are calling.",0.402805720240513
"Brought to you by the Truth Tellers.Film is great overall and in this genre at least, is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre. Definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the MCU.Like many of the other Marvel Films in the MCU, they have to start somewhere. As an origin film it does it very well and perhaps the best origin / starting film for superhero movies that is full of action, decent story that is somewhat predictable (as it is for most origin stories) though generally fresh, fun and great characters. Definitely one to watch.Final Verdict - Does what it is meant to do and provides the entertainment while doing it.",0.4028057202405129
"What more do you want?I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""",0.4028057202405129
"This is one of the MCUs finest movie.The VFXs are the best, the story is the best and the Direction...Amazing direction.The movie is full of adventure. A Must Watch !!",0.40280572024051287
Best movie marvel made imo.And probably my best theatre experience.,0.40280572024051287
"The cinematography is good. The story is a bit slow, the fighting scenes are great but in the middle of some they just stop and stare at each other or just talk.Its' not the best mcu film and not close to the best ones.But it's a good movie to watch in the theaters.",0.40280572024051287
"Shang-Chi leaves San Francisco with his friend Katy in pursuit of old family secrets and discovers crime, danger, previously unknown family, quite a lot of wire-fu, ancient myths, and a couple of faces familiar to those who follow the MCU.This is the first MCU movie where I have been completely unfamiliar with the source material and, therefore not sure what to expect other than martial arts.well, I've seen a fair number of martial arts movies (without seeking them out), so the building blocks for Shang-Chi are not unfamiliar.But they are very engagingly assembled. The story is strong, with moral ambivalence playing a part. The action is extremely well choreographed and, at times - and in common with the settings and costumes - quite beautiful. This is a gorgeous film to watch. The effects are, as expected, first rate.The script is good, with much more laughter than I expected. It is helped here by Awkwafina - playing her typical raucous character she adds a welcome note of humorous disrespect, yet she also acts well and is sympathetically in tune with the plot and characters. Michelle Yeoh is stable and relatable. The leading character is, arguably, a little light on charisma, but this is not necessarily a bad thing given that one of the main plot threads is about Shang-Chi finding himself.",0.4003016981229439
"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed.",0.4003016981229438
"Marvel Studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade, and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema, Asian representation, and the studio as a whole. Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further.",0.3925363618948649
"Growing up as a kid on kung fu movies, Went into shang-chi with opened mind.Well, It blown me away, The cast were outstanding, the visual effects, Cinematography, vibrant colours, the fight scenes are fantastic and Enjoyed the music as well.Found myself laughing at time, exited and emotional.MCU have added more characters, diversity and new possibilities.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
was spectacular movie to watch.",0.38891839443608495
Outstanding marvel movie and waiting for the new version of avengers.,0.3889183944360849
"An incredible MCU film. It offers nothing too cerebral, but that is not the main focus of the film. The comedy, the action, the themes, the choreography and the vibrant visuals make this film a standout among similar standalone Marvel films, while the layered and truly epic soundtrack is the finishing touch. While some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished, and the final battle had some weaknesses, this is a colourful, emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film. Tony Leung is by far the standout member of the cast, delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain. Simu Liu holds his own, but needs more time to really shine as a new Marvel superhero-while Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina and Fala Chen are integral to this film's effectiveness. Overall, this fun and touching movie is an exemplar of the 'Marvel formula' and its strengths.",0.3871301247486863
"First off, this is a decent movie.Sure, there's a buttload of tropey nonsense, small furry Disney creatures and all that, but overall it's a good MCU inclusion and Simu Liu is great, as are MOST of the other actors.The story is pretty decent, although a little over the place in parts, and does a pretty nice job of including it in the overall MCU as well as adding some nice Chinese mythical callbacks or whatever you would call them.The acting is excellent, especially Tony Leung who I would say is the most relatable antagonist since Marvel's Daredevil and the superb Kingpin.However, there's some pretty bad parts too. Awkwafina does well to not be quite as annoying as she's been in other parts, but is given WAY too much credit and screen time considering she's just Shang Chi's buddy and has no actual skill or reason to be there. Especially with how's she's treated by Wong later in the movie. Why Marvel needs her to be included quite as much I've no idea. Especially considering how great Shang Chi and his sister were in the film.Lastly, the fight choreography. It is VERY good. An absolute tribute to the late Brad Allan and was a joy to watch. Especially the close up work and the Chinese weaponry which was displayed super well.Overall, it's well worth a cinema visit. It's a good film and doesn't deserve all the 1 star reviews AT ALL.",0.38713012474868624
"Another lame attempt from Disney own Marvel to cash in on an old school Marvel character. Completely ruined another character that has a 40+ year history. Story base on little to no facts and showed little abilities of the character. If you cant get the story right just come up was a totally new character.I'm so glad i got out of comics back in 2003 Disney is doing nothing but ruining the history of everything they touch. I should have stayed at home and watched the Netflix movie ""Kate"" and saved my money. Even ""Jolt"" had more action.Spoiler Jolt and Kate were better movies.",0.38569684349829986
"I was pleasantly surprised by a few things:
1. The plot was simple and thus mostly free of unignorable holes.2. Integration of the Chinese elements were quite well done.3. Reasonable development of characters including the bad guy.4. (Mostly) very well orchestrated fight sequences. Quite enjoyable actually. Felt like Jackie Chan at times.5. The movie has a very good tempo. Action and story development do not feel out of the place.6. Not too many of the typical silly wisecracks. Still quite some but not as ridiculous as some movies.There're some stuff one can pick on like the girlfriend and sidekicks felt a bit out of place, some development was a bit too abrupt, plot too simple and typical etc. But none of these prevented the movie from being a quite enjoyable experience.",0.3829883867563881
"It is.. impressive! Not because of the narrative which is pretty normal, nor the performance which is somewhat above average, it is impressive for the proper use of elements from Chinese myth.When the crew arrived the hidden Talo village, it is such wow! The mythical animals are exactly what I image them to be, the Long(dragon), Feng (fire bird), Kirin, Nine tail fox. It feels like they just came out of the Chinese mythical stories that passed down from generation to generation.And the Kong-fu too! The use of Tai-chi movement is smart, combining with the natural magic, the visual presentation is great! It is definitely a good movie for Kong-fu fans.The narrative is not bad, the legendary villain gave up everything for a beautiful girl, they lived happy life until his wife was killed during his enemy's vengeance. The miss of his wife led him to break the portal that blocks powerful alien monster. His son, inherited the power from both him and his wife, found his way to defeat the villain and the monster. The world turns to peace once again!Overall, 7 star for the narrative and performance, 1 additional star for the Kongfu and another for the mythical elements, absolutely love those animals!",0.373845248952135
Shang-Chi was honestly amazing. The cinematic experience was great and the story and plot of the movie was very good too. I am a huge marvel fan and it makes me happy to see that they are branching out to different types of hero's from all types of backgrounds. To sum up my review I really enjoyed it and highly recommend. (stay for the credits to the end),0.35355339059327373

"The film contains a lot of confusing plot points that really make the whole story look underwhelming and uninteresting.Why is Shang Chi's father so blind (or stupid) that he cannot see he is being deceived by some otherworldly being? Even after he sees that he released some kind flying demons out? And after Shang Chi tried to politely explain him this a few times?Oh, and the father was just wasted within seconds and the mega-powerful ten rings didn't help him much.And this otherworldly being... The CGI monster. What exactly is it? It turns out to be the main villain of the film, but it's hard care about it at all.I loved the jokes in the movie, and the first hour was fine, but the rest is just disappointing.",0.35355339059327373
"Couple of things, 1. The actors are made of plastic, I know it wasn't a CGI cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been. Have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley. 2. Feels alot more like a Disney film and less like a Marvel super hero movie. 3. It was super formulaic, Awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced. Overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other Kung Fu Movie. Kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie. Kind of lame.",0.35355339059327373

"'Shang-Chi & the Legend of the Ten Rings' (or SCLTR?) feels like the proper start of MCU's phase 4, with a clear link forming to 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'. We're first introduced to what seems like a Chinese fairytale, as we follow Wenwu (Leung) and his millennium of power with 10 enchanted rings/bracelets. We then meet Li (Chen), who turns out to be the mum of Shang-Chi (Liu) & Xialing (Zhang).How the mystical realm of Ta Lo fits in and it's secrets aren't revealed until the third act, and after the intro, the film does well to show Shang-Chi & Katy (Awkwafina) living their somewhat unfulfilled lives in San Francisco, before the action starts to heat up when Shang-Chi goes looking for his sister. All the actors are very likeable, especially Leung, who does a great job of making sure Wenwu doesn't descend into a caricature of a bad guy, but truly feels like a misguided father. Some great cameos also round everything out and it's always great to see Michelle Yeoh.While a bit slow in some parts, the martial arts scenes and action near the end are great, without being overwhelming - certainly up there with 'Hero' & 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. Also a nice nod to 'Raya & the Last Dragon'! Nice ending and character arc for Shang-Chi - I look forward to seeing him find his place in the MCU.",0.35355339059327373
"The best amount of tension and humor, with a great storyline and great characters. LOVED IT.",0.35355339059327373
"Shang-Chi, is an excellent Kung-Fu movie. And it's the less ""Marvel"" movie of the Marvel movies. I mean that as a compliment. There's not much connection to anything else. Not 50 characters included for no reasons. Not a ""check it out guys, it's gonna be so cool in the next movie, I promise!"" vibe, that damages the story.It's basically a less poetic and less romantic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Michelle Yeoh (still friggin awesome and butt-kicking at 59 years-old) is even playing in both movies.There's pretty colors, fantastical elements, comedy elements... but under everything, there's a cool story of revenge, of abandonment, of murder, of family and grief. Well, it's a great Kung-Fu movie, not a formulaic super-hero movie.Simu Liu is really charismatic and the fight scenes are awesome (some still sucks, though, because of too much CGI).The actress that plays Shang-Chi's sister is great too and I hope we see her in more movies.Well, everybody is fantastic in the movie (especially Ben Kingsley).It's been a while that I didn't loved a Marvel movie so much and it gives me some optimism on what can still happen with the MCU.",0.35355339059327373
"With no real concept of the character or the story, I didn't really know what to expect from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I was pleasantly surprised. This Marvel action film is above average, and features impressive visuals, engaging action scenes, and entertaining characters. There are some missing pieces in the story, which they may be saving for later, but overall, I enjoyed this introduction to a new MCU superhero.",0.35355339059327373

"It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and The cinematography, choreography, plot - it could not have been done better. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. CGI and the fight scenes were stunning!The perfect start for phase 4 (I know, the start is with black widow but is something ""old"")Marvel hasn't made such a masterpiece since Black Panther.",0.35355339059327373
"For a guy like me, that grown up watching Jackie Chan's kung fu movies, this film was a wonderful experience!Besides all the perfect fight scenes and amazing special effects the story telling was terrific, I was completely moved by Shang-Chi's story and his family's.And the ending was awesome as well! I don't have too much to say, just a wonderful feeling that this movie gave me!",0.35355339059327373
"I really liked the movie. The fight scenes were great and CGI was excellent. My only confusion was why some characters were so shocked that there were mystical creatures and the story that Shawn and Katie was telling their friends was so unbelievable to them especially since the timeline of this movie takes place after End Game. Did they not see aliens come down with crazy abilities? I think once this happens, someone has to believe that anything is possible.",0.35355339059327373

This movie was awesome. It felt like an entirely different experience with amazing CGI. Tony Leung really shone in this movie. It definitely focuses on introducing new characters unlike what people think that these solo mcu movies are just there to set up for a must see event.I just don't understand why people are rating this one star when it hasn't even been released in the majority of countries. People just be hating for no reason.,0.35355339059327373
"I left the theater almost speechless, I went in with pretty high expectations, As a Asian-American person I didn't really know what to expect from the MCU since it was really their first time introducing this type of culture and character into their franchise, but after seeing this it met all my expectations from the cinematography, to the lore of Chinese mythology and action. I hope this film gets the hype it deserves it ties in with the bigger MCU and leaves some mystery for the anticipation of more.",0.35355339059327373
"This movie is it, the whole time I was in awe, everybody in the theater were. Don't read anything, watch it, it's worth the time and money and everything. Marvel outdid themselves.

"When the movie first started... I felt like I was watching a ""foreign"" film. No English just Chinese with English subtitle? Didn't know what to expect in this movie. Then later on, the casts started speaking English & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in. OMG!! How exciting~ The fighting choreography was unbelievable. Just as good as Jackie Chan movies!The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols.

"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.",0.35355339059327373
"Overall: 91/100This is more geared towards non-Marvel people than for the Marvel people.Quick & Dirty: I loved it and would highly recommend seeing this film in theatres. Visually stunning, fantastic fight scenes, great story, and emotionally driven. Due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length, but overall, very enjoyable.When I was teen I loved watching Asian films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", & ""Ong-Bak"". This film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had. I felt like I was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new. I also fully enjoyed the combination of Mandarin (apologies if that's wrong) and English. A movie with subtitles always reminds me that there's more than the bubble of North American film.The acting was great. Michelle Yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day. Again, it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of CGI.I watch virtually zero Marvel movies and so if you're iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this film. It's funny, action packed, and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate. The acting is great and the length of the film, while a little long, is still exceptional.PS... there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end.Enjoy the show!",0.35355339059327373

"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting
The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.",0.35355339059327373
"Shang Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings delivers a majestic adrenaline filled experience, incorporating the perfect formula to a Marvel film ( Great plot, action, comical relief, and flirting with a love interest).

"I Saw this today at the BFI London IMAX with my 14 year old and his friend and we all enjoyed this immensely! Its thrilling & races along at a great pace from the first scene! It is the perfect mix of Action Fantasy & lighthearted comedy with a decent story line to bind it all together, one could say another typical Marvel movie churned out of their factory production line, however, I felt that this one really is miles better than so many of the recent ones due to the incredible martial arts fight scenes, they are so fast it's really exciting to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that I didn't recognise any of the main actors other than Ben Kingsley (who is hilarious) this often makes a movie much easier to get into than when it's the same old super star faces. No hesitation to recommend - great for the kids AND the adults too.",0.35355339059327373
"The movie was phenomenal in a 4DX theater. The fight scenes in the movie felt real and close to Hong Kong fighting movies. The story behind Shang-Chi is set up through his father, which is unique through the MCU.",0.35355339059327373
Great movie with awesome acting and stunts. Good jokes throughout the movie aswell. The story was awesome and im definitely looking forward to the future of the MCU.,0.35355339059327373
"Very great choreography, every fight tells a great story and the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Only reason that this isn't 5 stars is that the final act did what Black Panther did, became too superheroy and got distracted by CGI battles rather than getting into a great family battle between father and son. Still other than that the movie was fantastic and more people need to go see and support this film!",0.35355339059327373
"Compared to other action/kung fu movies, I think there's more impressive than those fights but even then; it still works. They well introduced martial arts and 10 rings and I'm impressed of how they use it in fights but I kinda want to see the unique powers of each rings (based in the comics). Still, It's entertaining, visually stunning and it's out of the MCU's pattern which is great. However, I'm not convinced of the Mandarin's motives. It kinda lacks evilness ( ""She"" is his weakness and that's why He's been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks). Everyone's scared of the Mandarin but in this movie they gave him too much of a heart. In spite of that, it is still a Great movie. I Enjoyed it Recommended to everyone.",0.35355339059327373
This movie had amazing choreography and a great story. It was a great mixture of comedy and seriousness and I can't wait to see what more they have of Shang Chi and the Ten rings.,0.35355339059327373
"Not sure how to review this movie, all I could think about was the other Chinese movie ""The Great Wall"". Effects were really good, but the movie was to slow for me.",0.35355339059327373
"The 10 rings was the best weapon in marvel movies, the animation and action was beyond amazing...",0.35355339059327373
"First of all, I think People are overhyping this film a bit like they did Black Panther. Is this the Best MCU Origin Film Ever ?? Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all. Overall its a really fun watch, but not as great as people are shouting it is.",0.35355339059327373
"Visually, one of the most beautiful movies in MCU. More than that, one of the best solo super hero movies in MCU, a grand feat for a debut, even more so without other superheroes like ""crutch"". The performances make justice for the script, showing us that End Game, contrary to what was believed, wasn't the end of Marvel Era. The phase 4 promises be even greater than others. This quality can be easily compared to Black Panter and Captain America and The Winter Soldier level.Engaging and with the right dose between comedy and battle, the film has impressive fight choreographies.The credit scenes make connection between the Shang-Chi story to the MCU in a curious way. Can't wait to see what Feige is planning for the future.",0.35355339059327373
"The movie was funny, full of action and very wel made. Will definitely watch it in the cinema again.",0.35355339059327373
"""Simu Liu"" really brings everything to life and embodies Shang-Chi to complete perfection, almost as if he was born for this role, to a point where he will become marvel fans new favorite, and In my opinion, is on par with the casting likes of ""Roberts Downey Jr"" (bold statement I know), but along side ""Simu Liu"" actress ""Awkwafina"" will also steal the hearts of many fans, bringing many smiles and laughs to viewers faces and becoming something so much more then just a side character, fans will route to see her more and more in the future future.The actions scenes are nothing but bliss to see, perfectly choreographed fights that really capture the style and heart of martial arts. The special effects are beautiful to the eye and in the last two acts will simply blow you away and introduce you to a new world to see and new life to capture you and completely immerse you into the world of Shang-Chi.As for the story, Shang-Chi carries alot of weight and heart, that will provide many laughs with its humor but will also pluck the strings of every ones heart, with out saying to much, Shang-Chis story is something of a symphony with its story telling, what could of ended up being a basic story, end up being a deep, thrieving with life, story with plenty of meaning, with a broken family at its heart, each character has their story, taking their different paths back to be whole again. Some fans my leave with a tear or two.As a whole, Marvel manages to yet again, provide us an amazing cast to embody its iconoc comic characters and bring everything and every one to life on screen. Shang-chi, is a consistent adventure from start to finish and provides nothing but pure MCU entertainment at its finest, and will leave fans begging for more of Shang-Chi.",0.35355339059327373
"I was hesitant to watch this because i know how generic marvel movies are, but i was like why not? My mistake i guess, now i just feel like i wasted my money. It was so boring, might as well be streaming movie.",0.35355339059327373
"The movie starts good...but...soon begins the flashbacks and the nosense humour and anti-climax scenes. And then the ""mandarin""....
Seriously, this shang chi movie is the worst marvel movie of all. Its sad because the pricipal actor does his job well, but all the other characters are bad to the bone.",0.35355339059327373
An iconic film with excellent combat.Perfect new start.,0.35355339059327373
A beautiful movie! It has really created a great start to the movies of phase 4 in marvel. Definitely see this! You will not regret it! This is the part that contains spoilers. It was such a twist when Trevor slattery came with his buddy Morris. If you have Disney plus rewatch iron man 3 before seeing it.,0.35355339059327373
"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.",0.35355339059327373
"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.",0.35355339059327373
I've just got out the unlimited screening 10 out of 10 best marvel action origin film of MCU if u love action fantasy film this is Ur film.,0.35355339059327373
"This movie was phenomenal. We cant expect more from a solo superhero MCU film. Everything was perfect. All the scenes were great. The graphic works were so eye catching!! The dialogues specially the joke parts were great. In this movie they portrayed the family drama in a fantastic way. The action scenes are eye touching too. Also some parts were emotional when we almost cried....If any of you who have not still watched the movie and reading this comment,my first suggestion will be please don't miss the mid credit scene. Your mind will gonna blow up!!!",0.35355339059327373
Felt like an early Marvel movie. The movie focuses on one quality story without the need for crossovers to make people see it.,0.35355339059327373
"I found the movie enjoyable in parts but there were some boring parts too. It's definitely not a 10/10 movie, in fact nowhere near. It's a decent film that doesn't take itself to seriously but like all of these type of films it's predictable.",0.35355339059327373
"This movie blew me away with the effects and how beautiful it is , the fight scenes were so greatly choreographed and the tracking cinematography was just perfect and made the scenes flow so well , the backgrounds were just perfect and very aesthetic . The chemistry between the characters was just perfect and the jokes were funny, its so good to see a platonic relationship between a man and a woman . It is definitely worth a watch at the cinema.",0.35355339059327373
This is not even close to what the Shang-Chi Comic story line was.Where is the Marvel comic Shang-Chi Character and at least some parts of that story line?This is one of the greatest Epic fails ever made by the MCU so far.,0.35355339059327373
"The Action in this film is top top notch , something we missed in marvel movies and shows, something very similar to what we saw in daredevil and iron fist.I loved how this movie is tied to past and future marvel projects , making it an exciting and welcomed addition.Actors did 10/10 in everything , and the story was well developed.Don't forget : 2 post credit scenes.",0.35355339059327373
"This was my initial first thoughts before entering the cinemas, ""am I going to enjoy it? Will it be filled with cgi crap?"" Well yes, but no. It was so beautifully done, that it made me saw wow at the end. This is something that you would wanna see in the theaters, it was so beautiful I even got posters for free of the movie to remind me of it. It's a movie you don't want to miss, seriously!",0.35355339059327373
"I had read the advance reviews and was excited about the positivity and glowing feedback I'd seen. It means a lot to Asian-Americans to finally be put in the spotlight, and by a juggernaut like the Marvel machine no less.Went to see a late night showing on Thursday, Sept 2nd, technically a day in advance of the official release date. Happy to say the movie did not disappoint. I've watched so many Hong Kong style movies over the years and the Shang-Chi film-making team did a spectacular job of importing that authentic, Asian-flavor of film-making. They did the kind of research I've come to expect from Marvel's creative team, and let this team leave their own distinct Chinese style from using Mandarin-speaking dialogue in strategic moments, to the very distinct style of Chinese-influenced music (totally awesome!), and the kung-fu sequences on the scaffolding, which is something you see in many of the old school Kung Fu movies. Michelle Yeoh, in particular, acted in many a movie in this vein back many years ago.The filmmakers did a great job of melding old-style, Authentic Chinese Kung Fu cinema and themes (father-son tension, motherly devotion, male prioritized over female, etc .) with current Asian-American themes (underachieving children and over-expecting parents, general confusion in American society) and combining everything in the context of a fantasy-action movie with trademark Marvel humor to lighten things up.I was a fan of the special effects throughout the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed the ending sequence as well. Like other reviewers, I loved the opening fight sequence between Tony Leung and Fala Chen. It's wonderful to see that Tai Chi - style of fighting introduced in a Western, blockbuster movie.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a great movie but with Shang-Chi, I think Marvel achieved something more in melding disparate parts and taking on much more in bringing together cultures, generations and viewpoints in the context of a MCU superhero action movie. The next time we see Shang-Chi, there's no doubt most of us - moviegoers of all colors and cultures - we will be happy to see him again.",0.35355339059327373
"The action in this film is on another level,
The cinematography is new propaply the best among all marvel films.The last battle didn't really satisfy me but I enjoyed this film unlike many others,
I hope that marvel keeps it up.",0.35355339059327373
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)Well what a pleasant surprise, very much in the style of Black Panther, this origin story was really great from start to finish.I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier. Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable. I don't thing there was anything I didn't like about this movie so I'm giving 10 outta 10.",0.35355339059327373
"I was so excited for this movie and I was not disappointed. It had cgi, an amazing cast, a great soundtrack, setting etc. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. Other than that I dislike some of the bad guys, but that's what makes them bad guys so...
I was so shocked when I saw the end credit scene with Hulk and Captain Marvel and Wong. I love Shang-Chi and Katy's friendship and I just think that this movie is awesome. Also the martial arts and the stunts were awesome, especially the train scene and the fight in the Macao. So I'm just ending this to say that I love this movie and it's my new favourite marvel movie!!",0.35355339059327373
"5 out of 5 stars.Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.",0.35355339059327373
"Just saw the movie in the theater and I haven´t spoken a word since. The movie truly takes you on a journey you don´t expect. The characters are the most immersively written ones yet, you can truly relate to (most) all of the main ones. Tied in beautifully with modern culture, I love the platonic friendship between Katy and Shang it feels real. The movie has it's moments of just sheer beauty. And I liked the humor. Does it have some points of improvement? Sure. The immersion was broken a handful of times for me, however all together I loved the journey I was taken on. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet. 10/10 Fantastic journey, enjoy the experience!(p.s. The music was sick, I loved it!)",0.35355339059327373
"The action in this film was in fact a character. Simi Liu, Awkwafina, and of course Michelle Yeah deliver beautiful performances! Shang Chi is this generation's Iron Man. The MCU is in perfect hands.",0.35355339059327373
"Rotten Tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, but it's not even close to same level. It's most basic mcu origin story possible. What's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (Spider-Man 2) and another is super mediocre (Shang-Schi), but both have same rotten tomatoes score. It makes no sense.",0.35355339059327373
"When I saw the trailer a while back I wasn't expecting much, especially after Black Widow which was imo the worst MCU movie. However, the movie surprised me. The theme of a different culture reminded me of Black Panther but I enjoyed Shang Chi a lot more. I found it refreshing, the visuals were amazing, I enjoyed the action scenes very much. The plot wasn't the worst, but I felt like it was dragging out at times.Overall a very fun and enjoyable movie.",0.35355339059327373
"---Fast review: Good effect, exciting figth scenes, satisfying story---> I normally don't like most marvel movies because bla bla..
> However, as a martial arts fan, performer and chinese culture and mythology fan, i decided to watch it (because there is use of martial arts) and unexpectedly satisfied.> There is a good base, universe of chinese mythology. They may waste it but they definetly use it very well. Effects are realy good, i especially like effects of portals and water tornado of dragon.> Fight scenes (which is the most interested part for me of course) are really good, some parts are so fast to detect movements.> Visual effects of kung fu (not style of main character but his mother and her people) describe the philosophy under the style very well. Their kung fu is so smooth, basic and easily recognisable because most is traditional style.>I was very happy when i saw some movements that i use.",0.35355339059327373
"Marvel had a huge opportunity to make this so much bigger and better than just a premise movie.Beautiful cinematography and the choreography was more than just stunt work. Acting a little rough here and there, the protagonist actor did a pretty good job though. That dry MCU humor we've grown to see didn't quite hit. I know a lot of people wished they would have done much more with Mandarin as he is a pretty big bad in the comics and they hyped him up a lot. But I think this movie just makes people excited for THE NEXT marvel movie rather than truly giving this MCU story life. And with the movie being 2 hours long, it felt so rushed and at the same time most viewers were waiting for it to just end.And I'll say it, she could be a nice gal but Awkwafina.... I just know I'm not the only one who finds her out of place on screen sometimes. And that's all I will say about that respectfully lol.",0.35355339059327373
"Loved it all. The comedy, the story, the acting, the special effects. A new character of Marvel with a lot of potencial. Hope to see a lot more of this in next movies.",0.35355339059327373
"It was fun, beautiful, and different. Very watchable and rewatchable which is an important quality in action movies. Go see it while it's in the theater because it is a pretty set film best seen on the big screen.",0.35355339059327373
"I finally took the plunge and went to cinema for the first time since 2019. The movie was highly entertaining with engaging characters and a good story too. The action and fights scenes seemed very well choreographed and the special effects were a joy to experience on the big screen.It was a Marvel film that didn't feel like a Marvel film, which shows how versatile the MCU is becoming.I was highly impressed to see and hear characters speak in their native language, a risk as many people don't like to read subtitles, but being an avid fan of Asian cinema I was quite happy and comfortable to do so.Overall, a highly entertaining and fun film from Marvel.I highly recommend it. A+++",0.35355339059327373

So well done - so authentic to marvel!!! And it's just the beginning!!!!!!!!",0.35355339059327373
"What do you call a man on a mission to keep his family safe? What do you call a man who just wants to fit in where he belongs? A new kind of hero. We have entered into Phase 4 of the greatest movie franchise in movie history. We have seen battles, we have seen so many Marvel characters in the last 12 years come to life, but this new kind of hero comes to us by surprise.Who here knows about Shang-Chi? I just learned about on Friday and from what I read - I can honestly tell you his story is one for the history books. I can't give out the whole movie to you or anything to spoil the movie, but this movie was different from the other movies in the MCU.I was in shock from the very beginning to the end, there were a lot of ""easter eggs"" linking all the way back to Tony Stark, oops, I think I said a little too much, but I will say this -
This movie defied everything in the natural and supernatural realm of not only the physical, but the soul. It dives deep into the soul of a person, and that is what Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is all about.I have to give a huge shout-out to Simu Liu - like I said before - I have never heard of Shang-Chi up until recently, but he gave the role a new meaning and a new identity.Now without giving too much away, with every Marvel movie, there are some credit scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That's all I am saying.So in essence - I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: 11 stars.",0.35355339059327373

I thought this movie was long. 2 hrs 12 min. Felt more like 2.5-3 hrs. I was ok at first but as it went on I got bored and couldn't believe it felt so long. There were other people laughing and enjoying his side-kick comedy. It was all too 13 yr. Oldish for me. Not a bad movie but NOT a 8.1 tho. 5-6. AVERAGE.,0.35355339059327373

Boring, generic movie, would have been better as Streaming movie, then some people would at least watch it and maybe react to it on youtube, because that's where most of Suicide Squad popularity came. Wont happen with this movie tho, because nobody can watch it on streaming and nobody cares that much about this movie to go to cinema. Maybe hardcore marvel fans will, but most people wont.",0.35355339059327373

Another very mediocre movie from this dying 'universe' but some fight scenes are quite good and visual it's mostly ok too. Better than Capt Marvel. Hence the two points.,0.35355339059327373
Wow what a stinker! Who wanted this movie made? Who are they that this movie was made for? Clearly NOT China as they won't allow it to be shown in their country. Just another boring MCU movie. Probably was worth more than a 1 star but all those 9 and 10 star ratings are undeserved. I'd recommend waiting till this is free on your Disney+ subscription without paying their ridiculous mark up of $30. It's worth waiting for! Definitely NOT worth going to the theater and paying your hard earned money to see it.,0.35355339059327373
"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time.",0.35355339059327373
"Absolutely loved it. Must watch. Non stop action and all you can imagine in a good movie....
I am not saying any more, just watch the film and you will not be disappointed.I think I will go to the cinema at least one more time to watch it again, that how great it was.I am simply buzzing!!!",0.35355339059327373
"It's unbelievably unbelievable that Marvel went over the top with the chinese culture fantasy myth even tho it is too much even for the asian community. Nevertheless I will appreciate it and absorb it because the fight scenes are visually stunning and the choreography was exceptional. Fantastic VFX, SFX and CGI you can see all the details on Imax. My only issue is the execution of the good Dragon - it's too Raya the Last Dragon meaning it's too Disney more than MCU vibe. Also, I wish I didn't watch all the too many trailers of the movie cuz you lose the surprise. The 2 post credits tho - it's fun and insane!",0.35355339059327373
I have already watch this movie three times this movie was awesome. It had everything from action to comedy and the really embraced the Chinese culture in this movie. But I was more excited for the post credit scene and I think we have not seen the last of shang chi.,0.35355339059327373
"First I had some concerns just about the fact that Shang Chi is a complete new carachter we never met before and new surroundings. Well this movie is an emotional rollercoaster, worked out beautiful, with just the exact humor, great actors, very detailled fightscenes. And besides the story is very beautiful, it's about getting justice for their lost mom. And this makes it BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL.",0.35355339059327373
"I didn't have high expectations going to a marvel movie but, i can't believe i am saying it, it was really entertaining and a very good movie especially the acting. I hated when the dragons entered the story and i hated it more when they fought. Switching from a nice story and buildup to end up with some stupid unnecessary fight similar to GOT was an extremely bad idea.",0.35355339059327373
This is not a superhero movie. This is a very entertaining and well acted Chinese film. A MUST SEE ABSOLUTELY WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY...My Grade: A.,0.35355339059327373
"Well written, funny and well made, this movie make you smile, relax, laugh and hype you up at the same time, watched it in the theaters yesterday and I have to say that it's truly a masterpiece.",0.35355339059327373
"Glad to see a marvel story that is not a continuation or a reboot. Shang Chi is a lesser known Marvel Character. It does reference that it is in the Marvel universe, but unlike Spider Man: Far from Home Shang Chi stands on it's own has a story.The actors all perform well, everybody plays off each other perfectly. The scenery is so visual, it becomes it's own character. Fight scenes are so intense and inventive. If you think it's another superhero origin story, well it is but at the same time it's not. I hope we see more new marvel films in the future.",0.35355339059327373
"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!",0.35355339059327373
"Everything about this movie is great I loved it so much the CGI towards the end was lacking but that's not a surprise that they would do that to this Asian led film they did it with black panther as well
The fight scenes are fantastic I loved every one of them. All around damn good movie.",0.35355339059327373
"That was AMAZING
I thought nothing would take my favorite marvel movie place from avengers infinity war,but I was wrong, because Shang chi took it!",0.35355339059327373
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first marvel film of phase 4 worth seeing espically when compared to the extremely generic Black Widow movie that came out earlier this year. The pros of the film are definitely it's action sequences and beautiful cinematography. The cons of this movie for me were the humor and the films predictability, but the pros of this film definitely outweigh it's cons.",0.35355339059327373
The movie was absolutely AMAZING! I wish I can see it over and over it again! Defiantly will watch it again.,0.35355339059327373
"This movie's biggest strength is the action. It is so well choreographed and so well captured in camera that it is unlike any movie I've seen. That aside, the characters are solid and give depth to the family dynamic at the heart of the story. Where it fumbles is in the third act that feels like it contrasts a lot that it tried to set up in order to have an over the top fantastical element to the show. Overall very enjoyable and is probably the most appealing Marvel movie since Black Panther.",0.35355339059327373
"It was such an awesome movie, something I would definitely watch again sometime. Now this film is definitely one of my top 5 films, the storytelling was amazing from start to finish. The action scenes in this movie were very Jackie-Chan/Bruce Lee stylish type of martial arts. Loved this movie! 10/10.",0.35355339059327373
"Went to cinemas after year and half .Totaly worth it,macau fight scene stole the movie.",0.35355339059327373
"This film us well written and directed. All the action sequences are well choreographed. This is an origin story but it will not give you marvel movie vibe(in a positive way) until and unless you will see the post credit scenes. Yes, there are 2 credit scenes. Simu liu and Tony was the highlight of the movie, Awkwafina has also performed well. Her chemistry with Simu was extraordinary and her comic timing was also perfect.",0.35355339059327373
"Honestly, I'm very happy to write a good review for a change!! It's been almost 2 years since anything decent came out ( tenet was amazing too) but pretty much everything was garbage! I thought that bar of quality has fallen so low and no way back up!But HOLY COW!!!!! Everything about this movie is great! It's funny, it's beautiful, has great writing, great CG, amazing fighting scenes, and even magical creatures!Neutral non political proper comic book story!Well done Mr. Kevin & Louis!Please keep up! And thank you 🙏",0.35355339059327373
Action packed movie with comedy... and the KAMEHAMEHA.....,0.35355339059327373
Was such a great movie and then the climatic fight was amazing (side note if Disney got the rights to do a dragon ball z live action movie it would be great if they use the same director of this movie),0.35355339059327373
"After a disappointing Marvel entry with Black Widow, Shang-Chi is the return to form movie Marvel needed to bounce back off on. With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects. Overall, it's very well done and I didn't think Marvel could keep going, but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it.8/10.",0.35355339059327373
"An extremely boring film with absolutely predictable plot that is not worth paying attention to.Medium acting, but Katy... Total cringe in 90% of the movie.Fighting scenes is good.",0.35355339059327373
"POSITIVE
-great Casting (SImu Liu, Tony Lueng). Especially Tony Lueng because he look badass and has
great acting skill.-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It
doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet
his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the
mystery of the Ten Rings.NEGATIVE
-The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough
cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt
detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic
part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be
expected from a film of this genre.The exposition can be a bit heavy but understandably needed to introduce a brand newcharacter into this universe.IMO
Great way to introduce new hero. Great Martial art fight scenes. Great characters. Looking forward to Shang-Chi. Also Wenwu.Not a Top Tier Film in Movie Industry but A Top Tier Film in MCU STANDALONE movies.",0.35355339059327373
"This movie was amazing. Goes straight to my favourite movie list. It had an amazing story line, great acting, mesmerising cinematography and good humour. It had some spectacular fight scenes. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone!!! It's a must see.",0.35355339059327373
From the beginning I was fooled believing it would be a cliche origin story but completely shattered my expectations by the end. This movie is extremely fun and will leave you stunned by the end. The choreography of the fighting was flawless and give no disappointing action scenes. There aren't any groundbreaking performances especially by the lead. This doesn't take anything away from the film though and I am confident he will improve and become more comfortable. Don't leave during the credits!Absolutely needs to be seen in theaters! Great movie.,0.35355339059327373
"Marvel does a lot right, and a good fight scene is one of them. But this movie had battles and characters that are only available in the context of this new world and this story. Despite a ""classic"" and somewhat cliche story it brought me a lot of joy. Classics are classic for a reason right? Cliches are powerful in the right light. Also the post credit scenes! Yes! Marvelllllll you did it again.",0.35355339059327373
"This movie was fantastic! It did a great job of standing on its own while including little easter eggs from the rest of the MCU throughout the film. Simu and Awk killed their roles, and I can't wait to see more from them as these characters. The story was so compelling, and the theme of the movie was so unique and refreshing in an industry that usually white-washes Asian-lead films. I cannot stress enough how well they also executed the use of female roles to empower women to accomplish their goals. Katy and Xialing were along with Shang through the whole ride and played just as important of roles as he did. Lastly, the inclusion of Shang and Katy into the MCU longterm is such a good move on the part of Marvel. I am so ready for what's to come after that end credit scene, including the last one about The Ten Rings ;). 9/10 from me, Marvel is still out here killing the game. People who hate on this movie don't understand good cinema.",0.35355339059327373
"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.This movie however is not a failure.Why?This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.",0.35355339059327373
"Movie like this is way better to watch on streaming than on cinema, i'm actually regretting going to watch this. While Suicide Squad was at least something new for DC, Shang-Chi was absolutely nothing new for Marvel.",0.35355339059327373
"Marvel has stopped trying and no longer wants to risk it. Why should they, when movies like this get all the praise.In the beginning, Shaun was actually likeable, but as the movie progresses, he just kinda does stuff and his motivations are almost inexistent. The rest of the characters are bland and uninteresting.The plot is all over the place and boring, filled with explanation after flashback after explanation, which makes it too long.The fight scenes start off good, but then they just become huge and filled with cgi, and that just makes it boring for me.In conclusion, this is a weekend movie to see with your family when it comes on tv, the kids will love it but the adults will forget it after 3 days. Just a generic tasteless movie.",0.35355339059327373
"Saw this on opening night and it was soooo worth it! Amazing fighting sequences and choreography, amazing cinematography, amazing acting (especially by legendary Tony Leung), and the storyline is interesting and moving. Lots of LOL moments and surprise guest appearances. I rarely pay the $15 to see a movie in the theater but this one I will do again!",0.35355339059327373
"I enjoyed watching it, but the movie is overrated, it's ok, but I'm clueless as to why the critics gave this such high ratings. To much hype.",0.35355339059327373
So far one of the best movies that I have seen in recent years. One of my 10 tops.,0.35355339059327373
"This movie is much better than black widow, it's funny, it's exciting, and full of adventure!Must see this summer!",0.3535533905932737
Overall it's nothing new or very creative. I have no idea why some people pretend like it's new coming of movies. It's not. It's meh at best. Wait for streaming!,0.3535533905932737
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.So much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.I really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi's sister, played by Meng'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.I found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.By the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology...
I think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new ""universe"" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.Marvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it's all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it's my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it's a very pleasant feeling.The energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.The scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow... And the 'Grand Final' is quite simply epic, emotionally grabbing, and of course stunning visually, with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive.A jewel.",0.3535533905932737
Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best comic book movies I've seen! Great humor and intense action throughout the film! You can sympathize with the villain! The music is phenomenal (possible MCU best). Go watch it!,0.3535533905932737
Extremely overrated movie for no reason at all. It doesn nothing new. Only thing marvel has left is Spider-Man right now. Everything else is just super meh.,0.3535533905932737
"It's one of the best marvel/origin movies to date. Can't wait for what's next. It was action-packed, hilarious, and emotional. Family at its heart/core. The story was EPIC, visuals were great. It redeemed Iron Man 3 and Ten Rings. Wenwu was amazing, one of the best and memorable Marvel villains. Simu Liu shined as Shang-Chi, it was made for him. His portrayal made Shang-Chi an instant fan favorite. Co-stars were also amazing, they portrayed their roles perfectly. Especially, Xialing and Katy, such great characters. A must-watch.",0.3535533905932737
Okay so I know black widow was good and all but this oh my God this is the marvel magic movie of the year I laughed felt a rush of action and adventure threw out the entire movie it's just flat out fun to watch like every marvel movie should be so much fun so much to enjoy i highly recommend it to almost anyone. So much enjoyment here.,0.3535533905932737
Although i watched hall print bt this movie was too good that i can't even blame the hall print.,0.3535533905932737

"Made an account just to write this review. By far one of the best MCU movies so far. Amazing action, cinematography, and acting, combined with one of the best origin stories in recent superhero cinema.GO WATCH IT!!! You won't regret it.",0.3535533905932737
"Throw your expectations based on the marketing and promotional material away. This movie is fantastic. Yes, it is focused on the asian culture. No, it is not forced. It actually is beautiful.The fighting choreography is fantastic. You like martial arts movies or martial arts in general? Go see this one.The music is great. The humour is great. Actors are cool. Ben Kingsley has a great cameo. The story is cool. The ten rings will blow your mind. TWO post credit scenes that will blow your mind and a great soundtrack.Where Black Widow felt like another movie of the same Marvel formula, this movie has some great surprises and worlds that are fun to explore.Oh, go see it in theaters and don't wait for it to arrive on Disney Plus if you have the option to do that. The visuals are stunning.9/10.",0.3535533905932737
"Film is great overrall, same story we all know but the way it told is engaging and emotional, first thing i loved in this movie is action sequence, every action scene is so damn good. The soundtrack is amazing. The characters are well written, even a smaller role is kinda memorable, vfx is great but not in high standards in final climax, its not that messy but notable, there are two credits scenes dont miss that. It does what it meant to do(entertainment). Cant wait for further mcu movies.",0.3535533905932737
Imagine a movie with well timed jokes and action pacing sequences crossed with the magical world of Asian mythology and Kung Fu and you got Shang-Chi. 10/10.,0.3535533905932737
"Shang-Chi did just about everything right. It really was the Mulan that the live action Mulan tried to be and should have been.It had comedy, suspense, amazing martial arts, female heroines and of course a dragon.I went into this not expecting to like it but I was pleasantly surprised.If they only gotten Henry Golding a role, the movie would have been a 10.",0.3535533905932737

"Bringing martial arts into this franchise is well.... a breath of fresh air from Marvel. Showcasing a series of excellent action sequences. There are some very intelligent minds be hide this origin story fantasy sci-fi feature. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best MCU films. Pro-tip, at some point in your lives seek this gem out ! This is going to be very solid UHD HDR blu-ray and the 3D is very impressive albeit some minor cross-talk but forgivable as the are some very intricate set pieces for the left and right eye to navigate via the post conversion 3D. Very well done over all.The visuals were absolutely stunning, comedic relief was always on point, fight sequences were sleek yet powerful. The story arch is well paced and unfolds gradually so one can get emotionally involved with the films characters , the acting is superb on all fronts from the films talented ensemble . The directing and pacing is spot on.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and one of my favorite entries as a whole. You'll leave the theater satisfied.",0.3535533905932737
"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.",0.3535533905932737
Loved the fight sequences and I was blown away in the second half of the movie .. It's like on another level! Phenomenal.,0.3535533905932737
"Go an watch this movie in theaters.. the story,effects,action, comedy,acting everything are awesome. PS : and you will get 2 post credit scenes.",0.3535533905932737
Tbh I really didn't have a lot of expectations going into this movie because I was disappointed with the stereotype multiple times but hell yea I absolutely LOVED this movie! (especially Hong Kong films martial arts prototype and the other fight choreography)I have no doubt to these actor since I know them all (Awkwafina's role could be better). They did put a lot of effort into mythology although it's a bit weird. Well done marvel!,0.3535533905932737
The ACTORS of this action film did NOT disappoint! I knew if it had Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh it was going to be good! Simu Liu and Awkwafina were fantastic! They kept it traditional but also added a little modern flare to this kung-fu movie. Must see this movie IN THE THEATRE AND NOT SITTING ON YOUR COUCH!,0.3535533905932737

"What I like :1)the action, especially in the first half and the building scene that make me nervous and scared on the characters2) great visuals and good cinematography, colors, cgi was really amazing3)I love the acting4) a good villan that really do everything for a purpose not because he is the bad guy so he acts like that (like the villan of ""black widow"" movie)Now, what I don't like1)like every marvel movie the movie begins strong and introduce the characters then it becomes more slow with good comedy and some action and we go to a journey to the final battle full of cgi fights, OK guys there are some people who love cgi fights but not me, the fight was a bit terrible and predictable (honestly I love the action in this movie but not the final battle)2) the movie is full of emotional scenes but (do I feel anything? No)3) the music was good but not epic and there is no great theme for shang chi (I loved the music and the songs but it wasn't good enough)Overall good action movie with a great action sequences and good comedy and good villan and cinematography and cgi, but it's a *marvel* movie, with cgi final battle and weak ending and a good setup for what comes nextThank you for reading my quick review, this is my opinion, the more important is your opinion and remember not everyone one love the same thing.",0.3535533905932737
The movie was awesome and very inspiring to all marvel fans . Akwafina was absolutely hilarious and a great fighter . Shang chi is about to join the avengers for the first time after endgame. I have this feeling Shang chi and doctor strange will have to travel through time and space to Find all places that he's never seen before. I hope to see Shang chi travel to New York City or meet guardians of the galaxy and captain marvel and find some connections to the mcu .,0.3535533905932737
"The first third was really enjoyable, excellent pacing, well timed jokes and incredible hand-to-hand-combat scenes. I already thought about seeing it a second time but the rest of the movie had a completely different feel to it. The second part for me was a drastic change (basically after the group is captured). Awkwafina, who was good in the beginning began to annoy with too many jokes and goofy moments and she did feel quite out of place which continued for the rest of the movie. The OG Mandarin appearing was a nice callback but he as well felt way too goofy and is just a cheap comic relief without actual importance to the story. You could probably cut 30min or so of less imports scenes without hurting continuity of the film. The final part was surprisingly different than any other MCU final but still came of as underwhelming to me because I really didn't need another CGI monster fight (although Shang-Chi's dragon looked good) and all in all the whole ending was a bit too much of everything. First you got the village fighting the Ten Rings while Shaun begins to fight his dad (this fight goes on for quite a while and could have easily been the end fight) who later opens a gate which leads to more fighting between humans and monsters and monsters and other creatures - you get what I'm trying to say. At some point you just want closure and as I already said, this final part really drags.Sadly some parts of the movie looked way more immersive than others and what also took away some fun for me were the trailers that showed way too much of the movie which takes away a lot of excitement (e.g. Abomination scene). It almost reminded me of some old MCU trailers where they basically showed the whole movie.The music did remind me a bit of Black Panther since it's a mixture of classical/culturally inspired music and modern pop songs, I definitely enjoyed it.Overall Shang-Chi is still a good movie to watch because it has some talented new actors playing interesting new characters (I really liked Razorfist), a brilliant fight choreography and some cool set-pieces. Sadly it's clever and quick beginning forces the last hour +/- to feel kinda slow and unbalanced while the ending is a thing of personal preference. I still think you can enjoy the whole thing if you know what you're going into. The post-/end credit scenes are also great.",0.3535533905932737
Loved it.Up there with the best Marvel films.Funny with great action scenes and 'Kate' is the best.,0.3535533905932737

strong plot
amazing visuals
pretty serious movie, none of the typical unnecessary marvel humour.",0.3535533905932737
"Movie was jam packed with great choreography , visual effects and story.Some parts pacing was too slow but in general a great movie!",0.3535533905932737
"After being disappointed by Black Widows' solo outing and not knowing anything about a minor comics character I feared for Shang-Chi. But I was not disappointed.Straight off and you get a cultured vibe honouring Asian film and tradition and you get superb action and charismatic characters all well delivered by a strong cast.Reminding me of Jackie Chan in his heyday, the martial arts is fast and creative. Shang-chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild. But then the second half blends Asian folklore and Marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle. Without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to Dr Strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways.Whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy, any true Marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday. The performances are strongly delivered and Shang-Chi is likely to become a new fan favourite.",0.3535533905932737
"I don't give 10/10 stars on most things but this was close. The thing that makes this different from a bunch of other superhero movies is that halfway through the movie I was already invested in the characters. Most origin movies focus on one or two characters to make you understand where they're coming from to prepare you for the sequel. But in this it was clear that the characters were all people with great depth. Comparing this to other marvel origin movies I would say that this one takes the cake, each and every one on one fight scene felt so tense and also like a dance. The cinematography was also brilliant, I could tell what characters were thinking and how they felt from angles and hue alone. I also really enjoyed how the movie wasn't all about Shang-Chi but it was also about all the other characters in his life and how they related to the situations they were in with him. With all this said I have to say that my favourite part was how invested I felt with several of the characters, I could understand the villains, Shang-Chi, and all the other main cast. They made it clear what they were thinking sometimes without any words, or saying something else.Shang-Chi: welcome to the MCU, I am so excited to see what comes next.",0.3535533905932737
I saw all the trailers and all the press for the movie but wasn't that hyped for it if I'm being honest. Then I saw the movie and I must say...expectations were blown out of the water. The movie was great and something quite unique and refreshing for the mcu. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend.,0.3535533905932737

"My expectations for this movie was low, maybe it's due to the fact that there wasn't much hype around it but men it delivered awesomely.",0.3535533905932737
The movie had the most absolutely beautiful fight scenes. The hand to hand combat was amazing. Unfortunately the ending was a CGI boss fight scene. I wished it was more combat rather than a magic battle that marvel does.,0.3535533905932737
"This movie was so well made. Of course it has your typical marvel magic, action, and comedy, but it's really fantastic. The build up, the dialogue, the action was all very moving. This is definitely worth seeing on the big screen.",0.3535533905932737
This movie was perfect. Allot of action plus allot of comedy. This is the funniest marvel movie ever. Also the storyline is pretty good. Considering that this movie used to be a comic and now it's a movie it's pretty good and they did a good job on it.,0.3535533905932737
"I really, really enjoyed the movie. The fight scenes in particular. As a fan of old school Kung Fu movies and the way they design the fighting scenes to look was just my cup of tea. That built up and exceled when the super hero fighting took place as well, it was just fighting perfection for me.The soundtrack of this movie was off the charts, starting from the opening scene, to the train fight scene and throughout.Now the visuals... they were... stunning.Humour was well placed and got a giggle or two out of the whole cinema, especially with Trevor, hahah.If it had just a biiiiiit of more depth in the story it would be a 10/10.",0.3535533905932737

"I absolutely loved this movie, the cinematography, the flight choreography, storyline, etc was beautifully done. I also loved that this was a proper origin story that yes referenced the MCU to tie it in for future projects but was seperate enough for Shang-Chi to take the limelight as he should. Also loved the surprise characters that turned up, Trevor was absolutely hilarious in this movie with his partner is crime Morris.",0.3535533905932737

"Sorry. Kung Fu not my thing. Action sequences too fast to keep up with, end battle too busy and fast to keep track of who where doing what?If you didn't have an idea of the connections with the rings, then would be lost as to how this fits with Marvel at all....except for mid credits trailer.For me, below par, too busy and mediocre at best.",0.3535533905932737
This is hands-down movie of the year. Do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen! This is one of those movies there in 20 years you'll say I seen that on the big screen!,0.3535533905932737
"I watched the movie in real 3D, the 3D part was wonderful, but that's where the Wonder ends. The storyline was, well there was no storyline. There was no depth to the characters, 2 hours into the movie I was hoping that it would just be over already. Very disappointing movie.",0.3535533905932737
"Before anyone thinks I am a straight white male who is not allowed to have opinions- let me tell you I am asian myself. Now the movie is truly overrated. Action is good, Virtue signaling was limited but not absent. Cliche MCU formula really is off putting. The only novelty was the looks of the actors. I did not get overly bored but I would not have missed much if I did not watch it.",0.3535533905932737

Clever story with amazing martial arts and interesting backdrops. I enjoyed and appreciated the English Subtitles that were clear to read and on onscreen longer the most movie subtitles. The martial arts was exhilarating! Loved it! The CGI was colorful and creative. This film should win multiple Oscar Awards!!This movie was so entertaining I must see it again!!,0.3535533905932737
"Shang-Chi is a character I and many others, know very little about. Which in Marvels case offers up a clean slate to tell a fresh story. I'm happy to say they have delivered. Marvel's newest outing is a Kung-Fu superhero extravaganza, that is fully built on it's action and set pieces. The performances of Simu Liu and Tony Leung stand out amongst the pack and offer a great and rich story for Marvels Cinematic Universe. Though the film can at times feel bogged down by its origin story tropes, the direction of Destin Daniel Cretton, the overall charm of its cast, and story make the film feel fresh and lively. I'm happy to welcome this crew to the ever growing MCU and cannot wait to see what comes next. Hopefully more Shang-Chi!",0.3535533905932737

"I was blown away by the great storyline from start to finish, amazing choreography, stunning visuals, and surreal locales. It's happy, it's sad, it's funny, it's touching. It knows when to be serious and knows when to be hilarious. The blend between the classic Asian traditions and the modern world was a definite bonus. Plus, it focuses on a blend between mythical and natural. Besides that, it ties into the MCU seamlessly. The movie thankfully explains a connection between the faux Ten Rings in the Iron Man movies and the actual Ten Rings. I also enjoyed all of the Easter eggs. This movie was worth the wait.",0.3535533905932737

"First marvel film with an asian lead are you ready hell yeah. First seeing the trailer thought it will be a good film but turns out i love it to the core. This film has all the elements humor, fighting, acting all done right. The main thing that attracts me is that the movie didn't waste a single minute in any other things. Fully focused on the plot and nothing else. Things got me wow is fight between wong and abomination and after the fight discussion between them and also the fighting choreography and cinematography were too good that i can't take my eyes of for a second. And most of all it's not the kind of the other family stories it different in many way. So that's it enjoy the movie see it in theaters if you have a chance. Stay safe....And don't miss the post credits there is real surprise waiting.",0.3535533905932737
"I was expecting fun Marvel movie, instead i got some random kung-fu movie with superhero i have never heard of. So bad.",0.3535533905932737
"Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces a new Marvel Character/Avenger, and that's Shang-Chi. The way that the film introduced that character was great. Loved how the film jumps back and forth a few times to tell us about Shang-Chi's past when he was young and how or why he ended up where he is in the present day.The film had so many fight scenes that were amazing and the cinematography that was used to shoot these fight scenes made them 10x better and that's perhaps because the cinematographer of this film is Bill Pope who shot The Matrix (1999) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004). You could tell for sure that there are a lot of similarities between the fight scenes in Shang-Chi and The Matrix especially that both of them had this ""kung fu"" style of fighting. Loved how sometimes during the fight scenes the ""Dutch tilt"" method was used and it was wide showing the stunning set design around.The film is also visually stunning which I'm happy to call one of Marvel's most visually stunning films. It's a treat for the eyes.The comedy in the film was so good and used very carefully in perfect times which is something that scares me whenever I watch a ""Marvel"" film. Because these films are supposed to be ""serious superhero"" films. But, when comedy is used in perfect times, the result will be perfect.Akwafina's acting was very great. Loved her character and am excited to see what her character will have in future MCU Films. Simu Liu was of course the perfect actor for this role but one thing that in my opinion he ""failed at"" are the ""emotional scenes"". This film has so many emotional scenes that discuss ""family"" and the relationship between a father and his son. I felt like Simu Liu couldn't be able to deliver that emotional feeling to the audience because his acting was bad in these emotional scenes. This brings me to Tony Chiu-Wai Leung who plays ""the father"". Leung carried the whole film in my opinion. Whenever there was an emotional scene between the father and his son, Leung was way better at expressing and showing his feelings than Simu Liu.Loved all the visual effects, they were all well made especially that the film has so many. The customs as well are great and loved how sometimes the colors represent Shang-Chi's culture like the ""football varsity jacket"" that was red and grey that Shang-Chi was wearing at the beginning of the film.I got to point out that the last 30 minutes or so of the film are one of the greatest and most enjoyable in the whole MCU.My rating is 8/10.",0.3535533905932737
"I decided to go in blind to this movie and I loved every thing about this movie it's humour, acting and it's characters but most of all the fight scenes
GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE.",0.3535533905932737
"I was super excited for this film and at the start of the year it was probably my most anticipated film of the year. It definitely did not disappoint me! This film is massive fun, massive action and has massive heart. The action scenes are so cool and the choreography is amazing in the fight scenes and the martial arts look so good. I love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun. This is a good way to do an origin film this far into the MCU, it sort of flicks between flash backs and the present day and it keeps the pacing of the film fresh and quick. Shang-chi as a character isn't super well known but just like the guardians of the galaxy I think he will become a household name. The shots in this film are gorgeous at times and have some beautiful bright colours and amazing Chinese settings. Some of the effects fail a little bit but it's not enough to harm the film at all. I loved this film and I'm so happy to be back into the marvel universe once again!",0.3535533905932737
"This had so much potential that got sadly wasted.The few fight scenes in the first half were better in quality compared to the usual Marvel quick cut edited ones. They were mildly reminiscent of the Matrix fights( The intro to the Shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to Furious Angels from Matrix Reloaded and made me miss the Matrix films more)However, anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated CGI mess that is the hallmark of almost all Marvel movies. In fact, between Shangchi and Black Widow, I'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this. Shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release.)It didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma.Honestly, I am just going to watch some Jackie Chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver.",0.3535533905932737
I just finished watching this and all i can say is this movie is soo unique. From the action to the atmosphere it just made this experience so great words can't even explain. I'm so eager to see what marvel has in store for us next!,0.3535533905932737

"To clear out the reviews fight. I believe that the situation is like this:If you love martial arts you will love this film. If you are Chinese you will probably like it, and even more if you live outside China.If you are a huge Marvell fan you will like this movie or at least tolerate it.All the rest will probably be disappointed.It is still a Marvell film, and the quality is good. The story is less good, and at many points loses any common sense even for a ""superheroes"" movies that initially lack any sense. Marvell could do better at least with the story.",0.3535533905932737
"Disney/Marvel has been applauded for its ethnic diversity in their superhero movies.There is a danger that it could evolve into a cookie cutter approach. Take the easy way out and follow the Black Panther formula.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does ride that wave.Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is a slacker in San Francisco parking cars along with best friend Katy (Awkwafina.) Both live an easy lifestyle that involves hard partying. Their other friends have settled down and gone for career goals.For Shaun everything changes when he is attacked one day on the bus. Katy discovers that Shaun has some whip smart martial arts moves.Shaun believes that his father Wenwu a notorious gangster has sent the goons. His sister might also be in danger and flies off to find her.Indeed Wenwu is an infamous and long lived immortal thanks to the Ten Rings. He changed his bad ways when he met and married a woman from a mystical land called Tal-Lo which is in another dimension.Now Wenwu wants to be reunited with his children and go to Tal-Lo to free their mother who he believes is calling out to him. It might be a trap.As in Black Widow, the Marvel Universe is building up to its next phase of superheroes and villains. You sense that there is more to come and again this feels low stakes.Several characters pop in from previous Marvel movies. Liverpool FC is the soccer team of choice for Marvel.There is some balletic martial arts sequences and some inspired Jackie Chan type moves.However the shadow of Black Panther is not far away. The finale is too CGI heavy and it turns into a Godzilla monster on monster type bash with elements of Dune.",0.3535533905932737
"After the big disappointment of Black Widow, it's safe to say I was anticipating a better outing for Shang Chi and thankfully I lived up.The action is the films biggest plus point. It's where the best scenes are on show, the choreography is brilliant alongside its kung fu/John Wick style fights.The visuals are typical of a Marvel film, solid as always. The film however lost its emotional resonance through its writing. The heart of a film mainly comes from the screenplay and I felt the writing was slightly lazy in parts and that heart faded.It's neither a perfect nor terrible film, it's a solid one that I enjoyed, even if it was hard to truly gravitate towards the characters.Quote - 'Welcome to the Circus' - WongRating - 3/5.",0.3535533905932737
"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.",0.3535533905932737

Oh wow! I really loved this film! It really went above and beyond my expectations. To tell you the truth I had no idea of how it would play out. As a matter of fact I am pretty good at predicting this but this movie really had me guessing. I highly recommend to watch this film. Of course it's a Disney Film so it gave vibes similar to Mulan and of course it's an Oriental film so it gave vibes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.

"Watched Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings - despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white ""Detective Dee and the...."" types, the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery, magical creatures, gorgeous costumes, no-holds-barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting, you name it.I do have issues, however. The first is that I think Marvel was so worried about offending China or the Chinese people that the film comes across as very safe. Far too much on its dignity. If the film were a job interview, it would have been for the position of senior Vice President at the Chinese equivalent of the Louvre. Even Akwafina, who I usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly-laugh of a good time, was very composed and restrained.I'm also wondering why they bothered including Shang-Chi's sister. She doesn't really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film. Even in the after-scene, she's not there. As far as I can tell, the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get Shang-Chi to Macau (bonus points for it not being the overused Hong Kong or Singapore!).Dignity or not, there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient. The Chinese people are dignified - famous for it - but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour. I would have *loved* to see sly digs at Western culture, more commentary on differences between East and West (you can't tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated Chinese compound or in the States then just seamlessly segues to Macau's urban lifestyle!), that kind of thing - more than the stereotypical ""When are you getting married? When are you going to get a real job?"" conversation. Basically, they could have really *done* something with this movie, over and above a superhero story.One thing I *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film. They are so beautifully rendered! The Fu Dogs, for example - I was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements - ear flicks, muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite, the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! But there were so many others I have no clue what they were other than they looked like Chinese mythological creatures and I would love to know more about them.",0.3535533905932737
"This was a lot of fun to watch. The cast was great. They made their characters believable, funny, and told a great story. It held its own very well. The action scenes blend with everything they did. It's nice to watch something that takes you away, and you get lost in it. Great movie can't wait to watch it again.",0.3535533905932737
"This movie has great kung fu, wonderful story, good acting besides the usual special effects. I enjoyed this movie more than ""black widow"". The action would be home in any of the classic kung fu movies.I hope the shang chi and the ten rings returns soon.",0.3535533905932737
This new marvel movie is just bad. The main actor can't act and it's more about the side characters then him.,0.3535533905932737
"As I sat in the theater, my butt sore, I said to myself, ""How much longer? Can I fast forward?""1. This film tries too hard to please Chinese authorities and make Marvel money in China. All bow down to the mighty dollar!2. The pacing is GLACIAL. Shang-Chi is Mandarin for 60 minutes too long. My wife disagrees. She actually speaks Mandarin and says it means 30 minutes too long.3. The lead character has all sorts of mental anguish over one person he killed, but in the film before this point, we have seen him kill several people.4. Half this film makes no sense. For instance, the daughter of the bad guy escapes then starts an underground fight empire? Why? So there can be a cameo from another Marvel character and a big skyscraper fight scene that feels like it has zero consequences. And it does, because once the fight is over, they just give themselves up to the bad guy, their father. What?5. Why the hell does nobody have any guns?6. Isn't the Marvel universe a bit full of evil organizations that nobody has heard of? Hydra is gone. Now daddy and his rings are here.7. They clipped Awkwafina's wings to make her palatable to the brainless Chinese market. She's a dirty, nasty comedian, and they make her an idiot.8. White people are in the film only to play comic relief. There's Mr. Armsword, a buffoon. Then there's The Mandarin, an idiot. Why? Oh yeah, gotta please the Commie government.Ben Kingsley is the ONLY bright spot in this turd film. He's genuinely funny as the Mandarin.",0.3535533905932737
"The action, martial arts, and cinematography is top-notch. I find myself nodding in awe and saying ""wow"" in many scenes. I'm left craving for more action. I love the idea of power being combined with skill. The martial arts element really adds creativity and a whole new world of moves and skills open up. It's not a bunch of powerful people throwing out nonstop blasts or a strong thing throwing brute punching left and right.The world is beautiful. The musical guides you. The tone filled with art and symbolism. Beautiful all around. And shoutout to Ronny Chieng! Seeing him make an appearance was pretty funny.With some of the weaker elements I will have to point to the pacing. There were a few moments that felt dragged out or unnecessary. Some screen time was given to certain characters that didn't need it and they should focus a little more time on certain relationships.Overall I enjoyed the movie and lot and was left craving for more.",0.3535533905932737
"As a Marvel Fanboy, this movie forms the plot for a big villian entering into MCU from multiverse. The rings are a beacon, and ita calling someone, maybe Galactus or Doormamu or something big and powerful, more power than Thanos!Watch it in theatres! All the actors are amazing and I loved Awkwafina's role.Must, must, must watch !!!!",0.3535533905932737
What a outstanding movie.there was full of entertainment. I enjoyed alot.,0.3535533905932737
"I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story, you'll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi.",0.0

"Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid.

"Marvel has started its new era, which will be interesting for their old fans and will attract the attention of new audience. The film's director, Deston Creton, did a good job. Perfectly selected cast of actors who have done their tasks for 100%. They understand their characters and clearly convey their emotions. Gorgeous costumes and Joel West's soundtracks, with Chinese motives, aptly create an atmosphere of a magical world we haven't seen before. I won't say anything bad about the script either. I didn't mantion any plot holes, and the bonus was good jokes and a touching and sometimes tragic family story. Bill Pope's balanced shots and amazing special effects, which have definitely reached a new level, also go to the film's pluses. A special tribute to the director of the fights Andy Chang. Clear movements and dynamic music make such scenes a real spectacle. This film is worth your attention.My rating is 8.5 / 10.",0.0

"Shang-Chi has a promising start with stunning locations with a nice martial-arts-movie feel. The fights were nice. Of course we have some good cracks along the way. Later on, we get into the main story line and that's where it starts to fall off. The jokes start to make you wonder why they are kind of forced into the picture because some of them are very lame. Comedy worked good in Thor: Ragnarok, I really loved them. But here its just bad. That's all.The main problem with the story is that *spoilers alert* Shang Chi and the villagers could have easily made his father understand about the whole soul-eaters thing. That guy seems to have lived more than 1000 years and wouldn't he understand about the whole talking to the mind thing?One last annoying thing is that why the hell they are having two post credits scene as if they were any good. The last one never needed to be in the post credits at all. That's just a normal scene which could have been shown before the credits.Shang-Chi would may be entertaining for those who are new to the whole superhero movies.

""" If you aim at nothing, you get nothing ""Shang chi gets most of the part right with crazy action choreography which is undoubtedly the major attraction. First act is racy and has crazy action episodes and later, the recurring flashbacks served the story purpose but at the same time, slightly hindered the flow. Not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it. Third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of Raya.New guy "" Simu Liu "" owned the Shang chi role, as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen. Especially during action episodes , he nailed it with his quick reflexes, even Meng'er Zhang as Chi's sister did put up an impressive act and Awkwafina provided a bit of humor with her quirky attitude . Fala Chen is so beautiful, i fell head over heels for her smile. The man, Tony Leung stood tall and delivered with panache, his presence worked big time. Always love to see Michelle Yeoh on the screen , she got that aura which pulls me in. Trevor and Morris stole the show, loved their bonding :)Over all , with couple of surprises , good performances , amazing score , striking visuals and top notch action pieces makes this one an enjoyable ride throughout. Had a good time at the cinemas. Simu Liu is a fine addition to the MCU. Easily deserves solid 7-7.5 rating !!First post credit scene is whistle worthy moment , JUST WOW!!!",0.0
