453,watched ten rings despite movie title sounding like one black white detective dee types film visually stunning stunning scenery magical creatures gorgeous costumes fight scenes much dancing fighting name issues however the first i think marvel worried offending china chinese people film comes across safe far much dignity if film job interview would position senior vice president chinese equivalent louvre even akwafina i usually count deliver raunchy good time composed also wondering bothered including sister she really anything except moody resentful majority film even as far i tell entire point inclusion film get macau bonus points overused hong kong singapore plenty opportunity could upped humour quotient the chinese people dignified famous also ribald sophisticated sense humour i would loved see sly digs western culture commentary differences east west ca tell guy spends life isolated chinese compound states seamlessly segues macau urban lifestyle kind thing stereotypical when getting married when going get real job conversation basically could really done something movie superhero thing i really want see guide creatures see film they beautifully rendered the fu dogs example i mesmerized watching tiny little movements ear flicks muscle twitches reacting bug bite movement fur mane magnificent but many others i clue looked like chinese mythological creatures i would love know,V.Positive
